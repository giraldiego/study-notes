## 03 - 01

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**2 revenants**  
  
Use the flame belch on the group of zombies to finish the second challenge directly. Be mindful of the explosive mines, they can destroy the revenant's shoulder guns, but also you.  
  
The completed challenge will award a Suit Point (SP). You should have two, with the one you collected on your last passage aboard the Fortress of Doom. Get the **hot swapper** suit upgrade.  
  
Don’t forget to get the sentinel power cell.  

## 03 - 02

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**1 knight, 3 mancubi**  
  
Flame and stickbomb the zombies, then dispatch the knight with the usual shotgun - micro missiles combo. Switch afterwards for the precision bolt.  
  
Open the next door by standing on the platform with the hovering green circles. When you open it, disarm the mancubus with the precision bolt, and dash to the corridor to your right to isolate yourself while you deal with the imps. Wait until it stands in the trap, then trigger it. Quickly move to where the first mancubus spawned because a second one will spawn in the corridor you are currently hiding in. Disarm the third mancubus up on the platform, while you wait behind the crates until the second one walks into the swinging axes trap.  
  
Now look at the third mancubus. If it jumps down from its platform, kill it. If it is not, and is endlessly walking forward on its platform, then it is glitched and will cause you to not be rewarded this arena’s WP progression. You need to walk down behind him, jump on the crates around, and get it to „unblock“ itself by jumping around and trying to bait it to attack you. Once it is on the floor, deal with it from around the corner, for maximun safety. If the encounter on the map is green after the fight ends, you're all good. If it is still red, you might be forever lagging behind one WP on your schedule.  
  
If you ever find yourself trapped in some way by a mancubus, you should have three chainsaw charges to quickly eliminate one of them as a last resort. There will be lots of heavies pressuring you hard in the next encounters, so keep your chainsaw charges for critical situations if you can. Do not hesitate to use it on fodder demons if you need to, because starving yourself of ammo can be just as dangerous as being cornered.  

## 03 - 03

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 arachnotron**  
  
The central platform will lift when you enter, with an arachnotron on it. Take down its turret with a precision bolt once you see it. Watch out for those red mines. Use the collected SP on the **thicker skin** suit upgrade.  
 
## 03 - 04

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 knight, 1 revenant, 3 shield soldiers, 2 lost souls**  
  
Engage at will, either openly or by staying up on the ledge you came from, from which you can snipe the revenant's turrets with the precision bolt, and kill the knight without it representing a threat. Going down and baiting the knight into the trap is feasible, but risky. The lost souls spawn only once you get down from the ledge.  
  
Use the shield soldiers that spawn afterwards to replenish your ammo if needed. Otherwise, keep your three chainsaw charges.  

## 03 - 05

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
**1 cacodemon, 3 mancubi**  
**Chainsaw one Mancubi here

Get the rocket launcher, but stay where you are. Take down the mancubus on the other side of the arena with four rockets, and prepare the plasma rifle to finish it. Be ready to strafe sideways to dodge incoming attacks.  
  
The second mancubus is located directly to your left. Throw both grenades at it (freeze first) and stagger it with three rockets. Fly away with the nearby jump pad in case of trouble. The third mancubus will be in the middle of the arena, hide from it while you shift your focus towards the cacodemon that will have spawned in the vicinity. Be careful of all the gargoyles prowling around.  
  
For the rune, refer to the **Summary - Runes** section of the guide above. There’s a megasphere pickup behind the coffins on the platform behind the rune.  
 
##  03 - 06

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
**3 shield soldiers, 3 whiplashes**  
  
One whiplash will spawn from behind the crates ahead of you. You can preshot it with a rocket. Always shoot your rockets at the apex of your double jump, aiming at the ground. That way, you will take less self-damage from your rockets, and you are guaranteed a hit, even an indirect one.  
  
Make extensive use of the explosives around as they are very effective against the whiplashes and the shielded soldiers, and don’t forget about your ice grenade if you’re starting to lose control of the situation. Do not underestimate the shield soldiers, they deal game-ending damage if you let them overrun you.  
  
The two last fights feel like they were designed to make you thirst for the rocket launcher **lock-on burst** upgrade. Take the modkit, and dump 6 WP into the **quick lock** upgrade. You’ll find that mancubi and whiplashes are much easier to deal with.  

##  03 - 07

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 1 knight, 2 revenants, 2 mancubi, 9 shield soldiers 1 whiplash**  
  
Don’t get cocky in front of the five shield soldiers down the corridor, use them to replenish your resources. Don’t forget about the hidden SP behind the fissured wall to your left.  
  
Walk up to the 3 rockets laying on the ground and a mancubus will appear in front of you. Test your lock-on burst on it. Feed it a fourth rocket to kill it. Throw a grenade in the middle of the platform it was standing on to kill or stagger the fodder demons, flame belch and chainsaw at will. The two shielded soldiers here are your highest priority targets, kill them on sight.  
  
Take care of the cacodemon spawning somewhere (not always from the same place). Once it’s down, you’ll hear a musical cue (a drums transition), at this moment a revenant will land on top of the structure to the left side of the map, an arachnotron in the middle, and two additional shield soldiers. Take care of the revenant, ideally with a lock-on burst. A knight will then spawn directly underneath, feed it the same meal. A whiplash and a revenant will spawn to the right side of the map, and another mancubus at the front. Some additional shield soldiers will be prawling around. Run around with the plasma rifle in hands to deal with shield soldiers, and switch to the rocket launcher to lock-on burst any heavy on your way. Riding jump pads with the micro missiles in hand is a great alternative to rockets for consistent damage. Be careful, play secure and you will come out of here alive.

# 03 - Cultist base, part 2

## 03 - 08

**Difficulty 1/5  
  
**1 cacodemon, 3 lost souls**  
  
A cacodemon will spawn from left OR right when you enter. Sentinel battery to your left.  
  
Kill the cultists in the main room, and a megasphere will appear. You can press the button without picking it up, in order to save it for later if you don't need it now.  
  
After taking the elevator down and crossing the light bridge, you’ll have to break a chain and lift a cover over 3 lost souls. Don’t let them take a single hit point from you, you will need them for the next fight.  

## 03 - 09

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
**1 arachnotron, 2 mancubi, 3 shield soldiers, 1 whiplash**  
  
This fight can be a breeze if you know exactly what to do and everything goes right, but the slightest mistake can really ruin your day. Don't enter it without having practiced a bit. First, let's cover the cueballs respawn conditions:  

-   They respawn only if both have been taken out  
    
-   They respawn at the beginning of each wave  
    
-   They respawn every 10 seconds during a wave.

  
Before you jump, prepare a mental compass, pointing north towards the room with the super shotgun.  
  
First wave: Position yourself to shoot the western cueball inside the alcove, to kill all the zombies at once. Kill the second cueball.  
  
Second wave: From where you are, throw a frag grenade to the north or the south where the soldiers spawn, and throw sticky bombs at the other side. Finish whomever you didn't kill with the plasma rifle. Keep cueballs at the ready for the third wave. Note that it may start before you kill the last soldier.  
  
Third wave: The wiplash will land first, on the north side. Position yourself behind the cueball to the west, and shoot it at the whiplash. The arachnotron will spawn south only once the whiplash is dead. Double dash through the middle and position yourself behind the other cueball to take it out. Now more than ever, DO NOT underestimate the gargoyles! Once you've dealt with the two heavy demons, dispatch the gargoyles as fast as you can, because the fourth wave will start very soon.  
  
Fourth wave: Both mancubi arrive at the same time. One will spawn north-northeast, the other one south-southwest. Position yourself again behind the western cueball and take out the southern mancubus out first. Then dash towards the second cueball and kill the second mancubus. You can shoot them the other way around, the western cuebal to the northern mancubus, but as the mancubi don't spawn exactly in the middle, you have a higher chance of missing.  
  
Practice this fight in nightmare until you don't need this guide section anymore to succeed consistently.  
  
Once back up, pick up the crystal and get the **quickdraw belch** health upgrade. This will have completed the last challenge of the map.  

## 03 - 10

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 cacodemon, 1 revenant, 3 shield soldiers**  
  
Approach and shoot the cueball to the right at the revenant when it spawns, then dispatch the fodder demons. Don't forget about the cacodemon.  

## 03 - 11

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 cacodemon, 2 revenants**  
  
Don’t get surprised by the cacodemon when taking the left lift down. Don’t forget to grab the SP.  
After taking the lift up, you’ll get jumped on by two revenants. Dispatch them effectively, you don't have much room to dodge. Go up once more to grab the sentinel battery.  
  
The fight to get the super shotgun is trivial, you have to actually put effort into it if you want to fail there. Get the **fast hands** upgrade for the super shotgun.  

## 03 - 12

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 1 knight, 1 revenant, 3 lost souls, 1 mancubus, 2 shield soldiers, 1 whiplash**  
  
This area wants you to use your newly-acquired super shotgun. Don’t. We’ll cover each cell one after another, clockwise, starting from the one directly in front of you.  
  
1) Imps and gargoyles. One or two sticky bombs are enough.  
2) Soldiers. A sticky bomb is enough here too. Keep them for later to replenish ammo.  
3) A cueball put there for cell 4. Before opening the cell, destroy the hanging bombs around.  
4) A knight and an arachnotron. Freeze them, run back to the cueball, shoot it into them.  
5) A whiplash, a revenant and 3 lost souls. Open after you open the 6. Throw in a freeze grenade, then cueball them.  
6) Another cueball for #5.  
7) A mancubus. Lock-on burst + super shotgun.  
8) A cacodemon. You know what to do.  
  
In the next corridor, there are a lot of dumb ways to take damage. Play smart, don’t rush.  
In the next room, with the big floating artifact in the middle, grab the SP and get the **faster dasher** suit upgrade.  
  
On your way up, climbing the two columns, you’ll find lots of ammo laying around. If you don’t need them, don’t grab them, they’ll trigger 3 lost souls and 2 imps spawns.

# 03 - Cultist base, Part 3

## 03 - 13

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**1 mancubus, 2 whiplashes**  
  
This encounter is pretty easy to handle with the right upgrades, and a nightmare to deal with otherwise. Still, take it seriously, as things can go wrong fast and you will have trouble escaping to try again. Make sure you have 10 rockets, the quick lock rocket launcher upgrade, and the thicker skin suit upgrade.  
  
Activate the encounter, turn back, and lock-on burst both whiplashes as soon as they spawn. Then turn to the mancubus closing in on you from the right, freeze it and feed it the same medicine. Get your rockets back on the remaining zombies, provided they did not die in the explosions.  
  
## 03 - 14

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**4 tentacles**  
  
Before entering the gory room, bait and kill the gargoyles from the doorway. You can then safely enter the room and destroy the tentacles. Don't forget to count them. There's a megasphere in the middle of the room, above a crusher.  

## 03 - 15

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 cacodemon, 1 revenant, 1 mancubus, 2 shield soldiers**  
**1 Canister: leave with 2

Send the first cueball to the revenant, and the second one to the mancubus. Take your time, aim well.  
  
Get the **quick hook** super shotgun upgrade.  
  
Look over the edge of the map to the right, you'll see a cave down below with a full health pickup inside.  

## 03 - 16

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 3 shield soldiers**  
  
When you open the door, a hell knight will appear from the platform above. You can bait it into the axes trap, but killing it instantly with a lock-on burst is safer, considering the imps swarming everywhere.  
  
Upon opening the second door, an arachnotron and shield soldiers will appear.  
  
## 03 - 17

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
**3 arachnotrons, 2 cacodemons, 3 mancubi, 4 prowlers**  
**3 Canisters: Chainsaw one Mancubus, recharge, chainsaw an Arachnotron, leave with 2

This gate isn't that complicated to deal with, but it can still ruin your day if you fail an execution. Its payoff will not radically change the future of your run much, but 3 WP are always nice to have. I don't recommend doing it, enter at your own risk.  
  
First, take out the three mancubi. Flame belch and chainsaw your way through fodder demons, and keep running laps around the arena. Keep an eye out for cacodemons, and take them down as soon as possible. Afterwards, four prowlers will spawn. You can lock-on burst them, but the super shotgun is less wasteful and just as effective. The chrono strike rune is excellent for that purpose. Don't grow overconfident with the super shotgun against the arachnotrons, take them out from a distance.  
  
## 03 - 18

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
**2 arachnotrons, 1 hell knight, 3 revenants, 1 mancubus, 5 shield soldiers, 1 whiplash**  
  
Don't forget to collect the SP before advancing, watch your map.  
  
You can disarm two revenants with the precision bolt and kill two shield soldiers from where you fall down, without triggering the rest of the demons. Kill shield soldiers as soon as you see them, lock-on burst for the whiplash and the mancubus, standard means for the rest. Don’t grow overconfident, keep a safety distance between you and any dangerous heavy demon around and everything will go well.  
  
There is an Overdrive powerup to the left, behind a wall that you can open by punching a chain link. It can help you a lot in your fight, and you can get raging with the lock-on burst on everything that moves. You must be very careful when collecting it though, because if you are followed into the nook by a heavy demon or even a shield soldier, you will not get out of there alive. The safest way to collect the bonus is to go punch the link to open the door, run a lap across the arena, and come back to collect the powerup. Remember: you will shoot faster, and you will have infinite ammo, but you will not become invincible, so do not use the powerup as an excuse to take unwarranted risks.  
  
Use the remaining fodder demons wisely to stock up on ammo and hit points before advancing.

# 04 - Doom hunter's fortress

## 04 - 01

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**1 mancubus, 2 shield soldiers**  
  
From the get go, you'll be greeted by a mancubus. Kill it the usual way and deal with the rest (you can try to preshot the first rocket if you are familiar with the timing). You should start farming for the super shotgun mastery now, by grappling and killing fodder demons as much as you can. This level is chock full of fodder running around everywhere.  
  
Shield soldiers will greet you at the station, once you climb up the platform.  
  
Don’t forget to check your map to find the hidden SP once you’ve arrived. Get the **microwave beam** upgrade for the plasma rifle with the modbot.  

## 04 - 02

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
**1 arachnotron, 1 knight, 1 mancubus, 1 whiplash, 2 pinkies**  
**2 Canisters (split): pick them out before leaving, chainsaw fodders at your heart content.

Take the jump platform, and you’ll land straight on a pinky. Blood punch it if you want, but always freeze it first. Otherwise, just freeze it and give it the double cannon.  
  
There are lots of fodder demons running around, and the bigger demons spawn two by two at most. Take your time, run in circles around the map and don’t take too much risks.  
  
Afterwards, you should have enough WPs to buy the **fast reset** upgrade for the rocket launcher.  
  
Don’t forget to pick up the battery in the arena.  
  
Later on, get the automap. This will clear the second challenge. Take the **permafrost** suit upgrade.  

## 04 - 03

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**2 cacodemons, 1 knight, 2 revenants, 1 mancubus, 1 pinky, 2 carcasses**  
  
When going out, two cacodemons will spawn. Upon reentering, a pinky will charge you.  
  
Next, a carcass and two revenants, in a large room full of zombies. If you haven’t already, now’s the perfect time to finish the third challenge, by killing at least 3 demons with a frag grenade. If you already have it, do not advace too much, so as to not trigger the revenants spawn. Instead, take out the carcass from afar with the precision bolt, and let the fodder demons come to you, while you hook-kill them with the super shotgun for the mastery.  
  
For the rune, refer to the **Summary - Runes** section of the guide above.  
  
Next up, a corridor with a knight, and a room with a mancubus and a carcass. Start being a bit more precaucious with the rocket launcher while the carcass is around.  

## 04 - 04

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
**2 arachnotrons, 1 cacodemon, 1 knight, 2 revenants, 1 mancubus, 1 prowler, 1 pinky, 3 carcasses**  
**1 Canister: chainsaw a fodder, and  leave with 3.

The first fight is not terribly difficult, and you can get away with most of it by sniping the mancubus and the two revenants from afar. Two carcasses will spawn only once you’ve reached the other side.  
  
Next up, get the secret inside the round tower you have to climb on, this will unlock the first challenge of the level. Don’t forget the secret SP in the hole next to the cheat floppy disk.  
  
Back outside, a cacodemon and an arachnotron will be waiting for you.  
  
On the crane platform, grab the sentinel battery and the sentinel crystal. Get the armour side of the **quickdraw belch** upgrade.  
  
A pinky is waiting for you behind the door back inside. Afterwards, a knight, an arachnotron and a carcass will spawn.  
  
Afterwards, an isolated prowler will be waiting for you behind a door.  
  
  

04 - 05

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 knight, 1 whiplash, 1 prowler**  
  
You will be stuck between two doors, in a small corridor. First, two soldiers will spawn, then a knight. A super shotgun shot and a micro missiles volley will do the trick.  
Next, a prowler to the left, and a whiplash to the right. Same warning, do not hesitate to shoot your ice grenade.  
  
  

04 - 06

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
2 cacodemons, 2 shield soldiers**  
  
DO NOT RUSH. Nothing here will do you much harm if you go very slowly and carefully eliminate one threat after another. Three gargoyles, two shield soldiers and two cacodemons will confront you one after another. Bait the cacodemons around corners, in order to minimise your risks. Note that they may approach you from the side, and if you advance too much, from behind. Note that the cacodemons will often get stuck below the platform: if you do not see them appear, check there, or ignore them.  
  
Grab the SP, and buy the **frostbite** suit upgrade.  
  
If don't have all your hit points before entering the boss fight, once you unlock fast travel, go back and fetch a full health pickup if you have left some around.  
  

04 - 07

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 shield soldier, 4 prowlers, 2 carcasses, 3 doom hunters**  
  
If you take the doom hunters very seriously, and play very cautiously, you should be able to clear this boss fight consistently. Those three doom hunters have roughly twice the amount of life of the subsequent doom hunters you will encounter throughout the game, and they have additional resistances (immune to ice).  
  
Once you enter the arena, you need to immediately dodge sideways and away from the doom hunter right in front of you.  
  
First, keep an all-time minimum of 5 meters safety distance from it. Second, fire the microwave beam at it until its shield is depleted. Be aware that this mod heavily slows you down, so clear the surroundings of fodder demons before. Third, lock-on burst roughly five times until its sled is destroyed. Fourth, repeat step three until it dies. During its first phase, it will be very aggressive, and will seek contact with you.  
  
During its second phase, it will try to keep its distance from you. It will be less aggressive, not less dangerous. The lock-on burst is again very effective, but both mods of the heavy cannon constitute a great alternative. Note that the precision bolt deals double the damage against its flesh as it does against its mechanical parts, so take your time to aim. Engaging it with the super shotgun is almost always a bad idea.  
  
Two prowlers and a carcass usually spawn when you destroy the sled, but sometimes they may spawn after you kill it, causing them to immediately despawn.  
  
If you have not killed 50 demons with the super shotgun hook, the second wave of the first doom hunter is a very convenient place to finish that mastery grind. Always keep your distance from the doom hunter, go where it is not, and grapple those fodder demons until your hook is on fire.  
  
During the second fight, you'll face two doom hunters. You should always focus on reducing the amount of fodder demons running around. Once you kill either one of them, two prowlers, a carcass and some shield soldiers will spawn. Run a couple of laps around in order to weed them out, then take out the second doom hunter. Take your time while engaging the doom hunters, don't hesitate to interrupt your aggression and go running around if you feel like you're losing control of your position.  
  
  

Fortress of doom

  
By now you should have 7 sentinel batteries. Use 4 to get the two crystal, and get both upgrades for the **belch armour boost** upgrade. Use 2 batteries to get one SP, and get the **grappler** suit upgrade with it.  
  
If you have not yet finished the super shotgun mastery, you can do so in the ripatorium.

# 05 - Super gore nest, part 1

## 05 - 01

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
**1 cacodemon, 1 knight, 1 revenant, 3 mancubi, 2 whiplashes, 3 prowlers, 1 pinky, 1 carcass**  
  
Do not kill too much fodder demons. First, focus on the three mancubi, before triggering the rest of the fight. Afterwards, once you have killed enough fodder, a revenant and a carcass will spawn. Once disposed of, a knight, 3 prowlers and a cacodemon will spawn. 2 whiplashes will spawn after the cacodemon and the knight are dead.  
  
The pinky will appear at end the fight. A challenge requires you to perform 3 different glory kills on pinkies. My personal favourite method (there are many) was to unload your super shotgun into its face 5 or 6 times until it staggers. Pinky wrangling is a dangerous sport, and can degenerate extremely quickly. You should attempt it only when the pinky is isolated. I do not advise doing this challenge, the SP is not worth dying for.  
  
Grab the mod kit, get the **arbalest** upgrade for the ballista. That’s already the first challenge out of the way. Get the **full speed** upgrade.  

## 05 - 02

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**1 arachnotron, 2 dread knights, 1 pinky**  
  
Stick to the upper side of the arena, the bottom is harder to move around, and you need space in order to deal with the heavies there. The first dread knight spawns right in front of you, the second spawns from where you just came from, once the arachnotron is triggered.  
  
Get the SP by breaking the wall and jumping on the platform with the full armour pickup. Mind the pinky, you will need all the hit points you can have for the next fight.  
  
  

## 05 – 03

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
2 tentacles, 1 shield soldier, 1 prowler, 1 carcass, 1 totem**  
  
This arena is brutal. You need to kill some fodder demons until a prowler and a carcass appear. The prowler is extremely dangerous. Once it is dead, the portals will be opened. It is imperative that you destroy the totem as soon as possible.  
  
You can jump around in the room and wrestle with all the roid raged demons around if you feel extra heroic today, or you can rush across the room, reach the high ground and assume a defensive position from there. The shield soldier might stand in your way, you must keep your distance at all costs. Once in defensive position, kill the demons from up there or wait for them to come up to you. When the prowler spawns, have your super shotgun ready to immobilise it with the meat hook.  
  
Once you kill the prowler, the teleporters will open. You want to enter the one directly to your right when entering the arena, which is the one on your far left as seen from the safe spot discussed above. As long as the totem stands, the three other teleporters will send you to an early grave, and prowlers will continuously spawn.  
  
  

## 05 - 04 (Secret Encounter)

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**2 mancubi**  
  
Get your rocket launcher ready, and lock-on burst the mancubus on the left. Lock onto the one to the right (you’ll need to move a little, otherwise you’ll lock onto the zombie). And there you go.  
  
Get the rune right after the yellow door. Again, refer to the „Runes“ section of this guide for advice.  

## 05 - 05

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**2 arachnotrons, 2 cacodemons, 2 revenants, 1 dread knight, 2 mancubi, 1 carcass**  
  
There will first be two arachnotrons and two mancubi. Once they die, the rest will spawn. Get the onslaught powerup either at the beginning, or once the dread knight spawns right in front of it.  
  
You may use the onslaught powerup, you will not particularly need it later when you come back to this arena. Don’t hesitate to pick up the full health powerup in the middle of the arena, but if you intend on doing the slayer gate later, you might want to save it for then. The slayer gate is out of reach for now.  

## 05 - 06

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**2 mancubi, 1 shield soldier, 2 prowlers, 4 carcasses, 1 spectre**  
  
After the two zombies, a spectre will come from the right and a mancubus from the left. Spectres are nowhere near as heavily armoured at the front as the pinkies, and a charged ballista shot to the head usually does the trick.  
  
A carcass will be guarding the crystal.  
  
In the generator room, you’ll get jumped on by a carcass, followed by two prowlers once you pass the electrified door. Play safe and everything will be fine.  
  
To the right of the chaingun, a mancubus will jump up. Two hidden carcasses will spawn energy barriers in front of it, so engage carefully. Throwing an ice grenade at the mancubus will have the additional effect of dissipating the energy barriers.  
  
Once in the radioactive waste, behind the rotating pillar with the fire cannons, there's a canal that leads to a sentinel battery.

# 05 - Super gore nest, part 2

## 05 - 07

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
**1 mancubus, 1 carcass**  
  
A mancubus will spawn behind you as you activate the nest. Freeze it and deal the usual combo, or spend 100 plasma to microwave it to death. Then, find the carcass down below, hook it with the super shotgun and kill it. Deal with the zombies with sticky bombs and grenades. And that’s your second challenge of the map unlocked. Get the **ice drops** suit upgrade.  
  
  

05 - 08

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 dread knights, 3 shield soldiers, 1 whiplash, 1 pinky, 2 carcasses**  
  
On your way back up, a pinky will come say hello. It is alone, so you may take your time and try to glorykill it if you want to do the challenge. Don't forget to pick up the SP in the canal to your left.  
  
Pick up the chaingun, and you’ll drop down to a duel with a dread knight. Freeze it and chaingun it to death.  
  
After activating the first half of the generator, a whiplash and two shielded soldiers will confront you. Freeze them and dispose of them safely.  
  
You’ll stand in front of a +25 armour above an electrified ground. DO NOT get it yet. First, shoot a projectile into the room ahead, to trigger the ambush set by a shielded soldier.  
  
After dealing with the soldiers and the zombies, two carcasses will appear up ahead, and a dread knight will spawn right before the electrified ground. Run back to the previous room to freeze-chaingun the dread knight in peace, and deal with the carcasses later. Don’t forget to pick the modkit afterwards, and install the **turret mode** for the chaingun. Get both upgrades if you can, otherwise prioritise the **fast gunner** upgrade.

05 - 09

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 revenant, 1 totem**  
  
Once you step into the portal, be ready to run. You need to traverse the arena in order to find and destroy the totem, dodging everything on your path. A revenant will be on your way, freeze it. Once it’s done, you’ve got no reason to stay below, and you can continue on ahead along the monkey bars. Be very mindful of the cacodemon however, as it may attempt to block your path. Once up there, wait for the demons to come up at you, and take them out one by one. Once it's clear, pick up the SP.  
  
  

05 - 10

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
5 tentacles, 1 revenant, 1 dread knight, 1 mancubus, 1 shield soldier, 1 whiplash, 1 pinky, 1 spectre**  
  
After climbing on the side of a building you'll find a sentinel battery. Shortly after, you’ll encounter some fodder and a pinky that you can try to glorykill. Freeze-chaingun the dread knight that follows.  
  
Don't forget the SP in the goo pit (the one with the climbing walls).  
  
Right before the blue door, a whiplash and a shield soldier will appear, freeze them and kill them. Run back to the goo pit if you're struggling.  
  
Down the corridor with the caustic goo, there will be 5 tentacles, which are easy to spot. You need to advance quickly, your hazmat suit wears off quickly. As always, count the tentacles. Engage the mancubus carefully.  
  
A revenant will spawn on the bridge outside.  
  
A spectre will appear in a tight corridor after the bridge. Grab the sentinel battery next ot the slayer gate key.  
  
  

05 - 11

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
3 arachnotrons**  
  
Drop down from the slayer gate key, and deal with the arachnotrons. Attempting to snipe their turrets from where you are is a bad idea, because the bombs they will lob at you are much more dangerous in such a room.  
  
  

05 - 12

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 hell knights, 1 dread knight, 2 prowlers, 2 pinkies, 5 carcasses**  
  
You’ll have a lot of soldiers to deal with, and the 5 carcasses at the beginning have the potential to throw you off your flow and make you do stupid mistakes. Once they’re dealt with, the rest of the heavy demons will spawn. Blood punch the pinkies if you can, but don't get too cocky. Keep running around if you’re low on health, and you’l inevitably find a soldier to harvest from.  
  
  

05 - 13

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
3 tentacles, 3 mancubi, 1 carcass**  
  
90 seconds is more than enough to make it to the exit. 3 tentacles will wait for you in line in a narrow corridor you have to dash through. You can ignore them at your own risk, or deal with them carefully.  
  
The carcass right afterwards will attempt to block the path, just have your plasma rifle at the ready. Harvest the fodder behind it for armour and health. The three mancubi on your way will shoot at you, but their shots deal no damage. Only their flamethrower are actually a threat to you.  
  

# Fortress of Doom
  
You should have four batteries on you. Use them to get two SP. Get the **hit n run** upgrade.

06 - 01

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 2 hell knights, 2 revenants, 3 mancubi, 1 shield soldier, 3 whiplashes, 3 prowlers, 1 pinky, 2 carcasses**  
  
If you wish to farm the chaingun turret mode mastery, this level is perfect for it. Fodder demons will consistently be present in groups of five or more, just be sure to throw an ice grenade before and to have eliminated bigger threats around. Practice the first section of this level in Nightmare first, in order to know when heavy demons spawn on you.  
  
First heavy to greet you will be a mancubus, followed by a whiplash. Then a hell knight, then a pinky, then a prowler. Then a revenant, then another hell knight, then a mancubus (be careful not to be surprised by it, it will jump from across a gap after the store). Focus the revenant's turrets for the challenge.  
  
Clear the fodder demon from above, and two whiplashes will arrive as soon as you descend. You can already lock onto them through the demonic barrier.  
  
A carcass and a shield soldier will come afterwards. You can use this room to farm the second level challenge, requiring you to kill 6 demons with exploding energy shields. You may succeed easily, or not at all, depending on the energy barrier's location, so beware.  
  
You will then jump in a hole, then go down a flight of stairs. In the following corridor, do not advance too fast or you will get jumped on by a mancubus, a prowler and a carcass. Advance carefully. (For unknown reasons, the prowler and the carcass may sometimes not spawn. Try backtracking, in order to trigger the spawn). Don’t forget to collect the SP.  
  
Right where the mancubus spawned, look to your right. There's a hole in the wall, through which you can take out a revenant and a mancubus from the next arena.  
  
In this section, you should have had 5-6 good occasions to advance the chaingun mastery.  
  
Once you have destroyed four revenant turrets, and completed the third challenge of the level, get the **faster ice cooldown** upgrade.  
  
  

06 - 02

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 revenants, 1 dread knight, 2 mancubi, 1 carcass**  
  
Whatever you do, don't step into the purple goo! First, stay inside the building you are in, and try to lure in whatever demon you can. You should be able to get one revenant or two, and ideally the mancubus.  
  
Once you feel like going out, turn 180° to the right and grab the monkey bar. Jump onto the land patch, then on the bus to the left, and climb up until you are no longer surrounded by purple goo. Once there, you can wait for the demons to come at you.  
  
Get two chainsaw charges with the canister.  
  
  

06 - 03

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 arachnotrons, 1 hell knight, 1 revenant, 1 prowler, 1 pinky, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
The pinky will come out to greet you. Once inside, don't advance too much, and demons may keep infighting despite your presence. Pick up the canister and keep it. Throw sticky bombs at all the fodder demons, and kill the arachnotron and the revenant.  
  
At the top of the stairs, you’ll trigger a hell knight. Take it out, then go up the stairs once again to trigger the cyber mancubus. You may either engage it as usual (see dedicated section of the guide), or chainsaw it.  
  
Afterwards, a small skirmish with a prowler and an arachnotron should not give you any problem.  
  
Grab the battery upstairs.  
  
  

06 - 04

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 mancubi, 2 whiplashes, 1 doom hunter, 2 tyrants, 1 baron**  
  
You need to play smart and remain patient. The tyrants spawn first, but will be taken out last. They can be easily outrun on this intricate map. Locate the whiplashes and the mancubi, and take them out with the good old rocket launcher.  
  
The worst thing that could happen to you on this map is to bump head first into a mancubus or a tyrant, which can end badly. Always keep a panic ice grenade at the ready.  
  
A baron will spawn when you kill at least one tyrant, and can be frozen and chaingunned. A doom hunter will spawn last.

06 - 05

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 arachnotrons, 2 cacodemons, 1 hell knight, 4 revenants, 1 dread knight, 2 mancubi, 2 prowlers, 1 carcass**  
  
This segment is another great opportunity to farm the chaingun mastery. Be on the lookout for groups of five or more.  
  
After switching building with the monkey bar, you’ll face a carcass and a revenant. Ice grenade them, execute them and carry on.  
  
Watch your map, don’t miss the hidden crystal.  
  
A few encounters down the road, you’ll have to punch a box to move it. A cacodemon will spawn. Don’t let it corner you.  
  
Later, a knight will appear just in front of you in a tight corridor. Collect the SP.  
  
Do not climb up the plane until you have an ice grenade at the ready. A mancubus will spawn ahead and give you little reaction time.  
  
Once out of the plane, a dangerous encounter will start. Do not overextend, stay defensive and wait for the demons to come at you. Take out the mancubus, then the carcass, then the dread knight, then the arachnotron, then the prowlers from the comfort of your plane. Keep an ice grenade at the ready just in case you lose control.  
  
Sometimes, some waves may not trigger, or the combat may never end despite no demon being there. Some of them may be infighting up the stairs, past the blocked passage, throw some explosives their way. If the dread knight, the arachnotron and the prowlers have not spawned yet, back off from their insertion point (at the bottom of the stairs) each time you send a grenade, so as to not find yourself face to face with them.  
  
Up the stairs, you’ll find yourself swarmed with fodder demons, and the occasional revenants and knight. Don’t go too fast, be sure to clean well around you before advancing.  
  
  

06 - 06

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 1 pain elemental**  
  
If you have followed my guide until then, you'll be able to fully upgrade the sticky bombs and the arbalest by the end of the level. You can come back here later, and use the only encounter in the game that spawns an arachnotron, to farm the shotgun mastery. You can farm the arbalest mastery with the cacodemon too. Be careful with your health and ammo though, there's no endless fodder demon spawn here.  
  
Ballista for the cacodemon, ballista + rocket launcher for the pain elemental, rocket launcher (or sticky bomb) for the arachnotron. Freeze whatever comes too close.  
  
  

06 - 07

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 hell knight, 1 mancubus, 1 carcass**  
  
Right before switching to the next building, a hell knight will jump over from it. After you jump, a carcass will appear from the office to your left, and a cueball and a mancubus from the end of the corridor. Do not walk too fast, in order to not spawn the mancubus before the cueball is in your line of sight. Be careful not to lose too much hit points there, you will need to be full for the next fight. Exploit the fodder demons accordingly.  
  
Pick the rune to advance the level's challenge. Take the **seek and destroy** rune, for the upcoming fight.

06 - ARC complex, part 2

06 - 08

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 5 mancubi, 4 whilpashes, 3 prowlers, 3 pinkies, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
This is undoubtedly the hardest fight of the level, with lots of fodder and heavy demons at the same time, harassing you from everywhere. Enter with the rocket launcher in hands, and dispose of the two mancubi. An arachnotron and a pinky will spawn in their stead from the left and right window, on each side of the path ahead.  
  
If you approach the left wall of the kitchen, an additional mancubus will spawn. If you approach by the right side (the reception, where the codex pickup is), an additional pinky will spawn. You don’t need them in your life right now.  
  
The portal from the kitchen to the wine cellar is a great way to get yourself out of trouble, but it is an equally great way to land into some more. You may escape some incoming fire, but you never know what's on the other side, and you may find yourself right in front of a mancubus ready to scorch you alive. Always be very careful with it.  
  
Two of the whiplashes enter from the right window. When you start seeing whiplashes, go grab the berzerk powerup below in the middle of the arena. You may want to remove the chrono strike rune for the duration of the power up (or whatever rune you want, depending on which one you took), and replace it by seek and destroy. You will have much less trouble finding targets to melee kill. Once it's done, start pounding. There is no wrong target: the timer stops during a glory kill, and each kill grants half a second back. If you see a heavy surrounded by fodder, destroy them all.  
  
Ideally, you want to take out all four whiplashes, the cyber mancubus that spawns in the middle later, and one or two prowlers while berzerk.  
  
Once it’s done, pat yourself on the back and take a breather. Get the **bigger explosions** arbalest upgrade. Put back the chrono strike rune back (or whatever rune you used before).  
  
Get the **bigger explosions** upgrade for the arbalest.  
  

06 - 09

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 arachnotrons, 1 cacodemon, 1 revenant, 1 shield soldier**  
  
The following encounter is really nothing impressive compared to the last one. You should have no problem dealing with it, but do keep your head cool and play defensively. Lots of demons spawn at once, and you might find yourself quickly overwhelmed.  
  
  
[![](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1644335490332187172/B60045F480D9862B5F2884D8E79E576ACFDE59A6/)](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1644335490332187172/B60045F480D9862B5F2884D8E79E576ACFDE59A6/)(click to enlarge)  
  
  

06 - 10

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
2 pinkies**  
  
You’ll get two pinkies, and a lot of opportunities to farm for the chaingun mastery. At this point, you should have two sentinel batteries. You can get all the SP from the fortress of doom with them, and don't need to collect anymore of them. If you want all the weapons mods, you need 4 additional ones, including the one up ahead. Don't forget to grab the SP, and get the **scatter bomb** suit upgrade (you may be a bit late on the upgrades advancement, depending on how many challenges you have finished). Later, grab the rune, it will complete the first challenge of the level.  
  
  

06 - 11

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 arachnotrons, 2 hell knights, 1 revenant, 1 mancubus, 3 whiplashes, 2 pinkies, 1 carcass, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
This is another intense fight. The arena allows you to walk around in circles, waiting for something in your line of sight to shoot. Don’t rush, and be cautious of the gargoyles. It is not advised to play with the overdrive powerup, as the bonus is way too short to be of any use, and thus it encourages you to play recklessly. Leave it be. There's enough fuel in the arena to chainsaw a heavy, just in case.  
  
First will be a mancubus and a revenant. The second wave consists of a hell knight, a carcass and  
  
A cyber mancubus will spring from the ground, once you approach it (to the left of where you first entered the arena) to open the way forward. Deal with it the usual way. If you have no blood punch, you can also pick the overdrive powerup, trigger the spawn and kill it with the microwave beam.

06 - ARC complex, part 3

06 - 12

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 2 tentacles, 2 hell knights**  
  
Easy segment if you know what to expect, a potential death trap if you don’t. Take out the tentacles carefully, and count them. There is one between the two fireball cannons, and one just before the drop. A hell knight will spawn between the two.  
  
Drop down, and you will find another hell knight along with lots of zombies. You may farm the chaingun mastery here if you haven't completed it already, but the knight is an absolute priority, as there is no way for you to dodge its attacks. Grab the battery on the way.  
  
In the next elevator, you may encounter a bug that prevents you from clicking left and right at the same time (e.g. for sticky bombs). Get out of the elevator to start shooting properly.  
  
Later, you’ll be greeted by a cacodemon in a corridor. Kill it with a charged arbalest bolt, and go to the control room just next to its spawning location, and press the yellow touchpad. It will open a door to the other end of the corridor.  
  
  

06 - 13

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 mancubus, 3 prowlers**  
  
Take care of the prowlers directly in your vicinity. When you see the mancubus, throw an ice grenade and deal with it. If you can’t find the last prowler, go quickly check upstairs. It may have teleported there.  
  
  

06 - 14

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
2 hell knights, 1 dread knight**  
  
After you shot the second turret, you’ll pass through an electrified corridor. You’ll get stuck in it with two hell knights spawning in front of you, one after another. Be ready for them and everything will be fine.  
  
Behind the next door, a dread knight will spawn. DO NOT HUG THE DOOR! The spawn trigger is just in front of the door. If you keep your distance from the door, it will spawn in front of you. But if you hug the door while waiting for it to unlock, the dread knight will have already spawned and will be waiting to tear off half of your hit points.

06 - 15

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron 2 mancubi, 3 whiplashes, 1 pinky, 2 carcasses**  
  
In the parking lot, if you're lucky, you’ll see a cueball and a mancubus aligned with another. Do what you want with it (wink) but be aware that an arachnotron awaits in ambush, to the left of the cueball, and will trigger if you go too far. You may either kill the mancubus with the cueball, or kill it from afar and send the cueball to the arachnotron.  
  
Take out the carcass, the whiplash, and the rest. There’s a full health boost in case you need it. The lower level has a mancubus, two whiplashes, another carcass and another cueball. Engage directly, explode the cueball or let them come to you upstairs. Get the SP.  
  
  

06 - 16

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 revenant, 2 mancubi, 1 carcass**  
  
Right behind the revenant, there will be an onslaught powerup (x4 damage). Either engage from afar, or rush to the powerup and engage at your discretion. The safer approach is advised, now is not the time to die of carelessness. Stand back, and clean the bridge with the plasma rifle or the chaingun. Alternatively, you might just pick the powerup and run forward. The carcass will be the only one in your way.  
  
Harvest the remaining fodder demons to stock up on hit points and ammo.  
  
  

06 - 17

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 Marauder**  
  
Hopefully you are not entering ultra-nightmare without having practiced a couple of times against the marauder in nightmare before. You most likely know the basics, but just in case, here’s a few protips.  
  
The dog has top priority. Don’t ignore it. The marauder usually only spawns it if he absorbs damage with his shield.  
  
Standard combo to deal the most amount of damage per stagger is: super shotgun – ballista – super shotgun. our to five iterations of this combo will be enough to kill or stagger a marauder.  
  
Usually if you see a marauder running towards you, it means he wants to melee you, and that is your cue to prepare your combo. Be aware though that sometimes, he may decide to brain you and to lift his shield and shotgun at the last second, which can be very disconcerting and panic-inducing. At all times, know in which direction you can safely double dash away.

07 - 01

**Difficulty 2/5
1 Canister
2 prowlers, 1 pinky, 1 baron**  
  
Very straightforward segment. You'll be jumped on by a prowler right at the start. When you take the teleporter, you'll be facing a baron. Ice grenade and chaingun should do the trick.  

07 - 02

**Difficulty 3/5
1 Canister
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 1 carcass, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
Awesome music starts, awesome level starts, „Warning, the Slayer has entered the facility“. Everything is made to make you feel like an absolute badass. But not you, you’re in an Ultra Nightmare run, in a fragile body, and the slightest slip up means game over. Keep your head on your shoulders, don’t go overly wild.  
  
Focus the arachnotron's turret that will spawn on the high ground in front of you, and kill it along with the carcass. A cacodemon will then spawn, and a cyber mancubus afterwards.  

07 - 03

**Difficulty 3/5
1 Canister
1 dread knight, 2 shield soldiers, 1 doom hunter, 1 pain elemental**  
  
Another traightforward arena. The pain elemental will spawn first, followed by the knight and the doom hunter. Be mindful of the shielded soldiers.  

07 - 04

**Difficulty 2/5  
1 mancubus, 1 prowler**  
  
A very nasty, potentially game-ending ambush, that is disarmed by knowing about it. You’ll run into a mancubus, behind you will have spawned a prowler (it spawns only if you went far enough towards the mancubus). You can start with whichever you want first, but be sure to do it swiftly.  
  
Ideally, deal with the prowler first, so you can take your time afterwards to snipe the mancubus' weapons, in order to advance the challenge that requires you to shoot three of them. Do not delay that challenge if you can, there will only be 3 mancubi on this level.  

07 - 05

**Difficulty 3/5  
6 cacodemons**  
  
You can try out your new shiny toy. Alternatively, you can use the cacodemons to advance your mastery of the arbalest, and BFG the rest of the fodder demons to get 9 kills instead of 15, that count towards the advancement of the challenge that requires 40. You'll instantly get your ammo back.  
  
This guide will tell you where you can find BFG ammo. It will tell you when it is recommended to shoot the BFG, in function of the difficulty of the current segment, and the ammo you will find later on.

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 cacodemons, 1 hell knight, 1 dread knight, 1 mancubus, 3 shield soldiers, 1 whiplash, 3 carcasses, 1 totem**  
  
Kill the carcass guarding the door. Before you jump down, locate the totem, against the wall to your left, under a bridge. You can directly jump on it and destroy it. A carcass will spawn right in front of you, hook it and eliminate it.  
  
The following fight can be tough, you need to play safe. Fire the BFG if you feel like it. Two cacodemons, one after another, will spawn after you kill the hell knight. The rest will spawn after you kill the first one.  
  
You should be able to finish the second challenge of the level by sniping the mancubus‘ weapons. With the gained SP, get the **frag stock up** suit upgrade.  
  
Get the SP next to the secret encounter.

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 2 cacodemons, 1 shield soldier, 1 carcass, 2 barons**  
  
Kill the two cacodemons with an arbalest shot, but mind the terrain.  
  
The next arena is treacherous, you can easily lose control of the situation and start panicking in front of the two barons. Shoot your BFG away once the arachnotron and the carcass have spawned (you'll get roughly 10 kills). This will leave only the two barons, whom will barely have been scraped by the shot. You’ll get your BFG ammo back immediately.  
  
  

07 - 11

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 2 cacodemons, 1 dread knight, 1 prowler, 1 baron, 1 pain elemental**  
  
A pain elemental, followed by a prowler, will spawn in the hangar.  
  
Snipe the two cacodemons waiting for you at the exit with a charged arbalest shot.  
  
A baron will spawn on the next island you get to. Try shooting into the huge red barrels around, one explosion can kill the it.  
  
Go get the SP. From where you stand, you will see an arachnotron with ten zombies under you, and a pain elemental far away. Shoot your BFG in the general direction of the pain elemental in order to net 18 to 24 kills. Collect the BFG ammo on the platform above the arachnotron. Get the **faster frag cooldown** suit upgrade.  
  
A dread knight will spawn on the next island. The pain elemental will perhaps not have died from the previous BFG shot. Shoot once more upwards, to get an additional 9-12 kills, if you need them for the challenge. Alternatively, the big red barrels in the vicinity can one shoot them.  
  
Get the **health for blood** armour bonus from the crystal.

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
9 tentacles, 1 hell knight, 1 revenant, 3 shield soldiers**  
  
Kill the two tentacles directly at the entrance, to give yourself some navigating space. Lock-on burst the knight, power ballista the revenant, mow down the rest. Don't forget about the empyrrean key for the challenge (hint: yellow touchpad).  
  
  

07 - 13

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
4 hell knights, 5 prowlers, 2 barons, 1 marauder**  
  
A pretty difficult gate that is simply unadvisable at this stage of the game.  
  
The marauder spawns at the beginning. Run away from it while you kill the prowlers one after the other. You’ll notice that fodder demons are slowly replaced by maykr drones. A good headshot is as much worth as a chainsawed standard fodder (they take 3 fuel to chainsaw), but they are slippery and overall more dangerous than your average soldier.  
  
You’ll then have to deal with the marauder. He is dangerous, due to the exiguity of the arena and the drones lurking around. If you manage to kill it, hell knights and barons will take its place. They are much less dangerous, but still not to be taken lightly.

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 1 dread knight, 1 mancubus, 6 prowlers, 1 doom hunter, 1 baron**  
  
Get the SP, and get the **combustion concussion** suit upgrade.  
  
It’s a straightforward battle, but a long one, and one filled with fodder demons. When you crack the wall open, be careful not to get directly sniped by the mancubus in the middle. Take it down, then the 3 prowlers, then the baron. Next will come the two knights, an arachnotron and some more prowlers. At the end a doom hunter and another prowler. Don’t be afraid to panic BFG.  
  
  

07 - 15

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
5 cacodemons, 1 prowler**  
  
If you're a couple of kills short to finish the 40 BFG kills challenge, you can finish it here. Or you can use the cacodemons to advance your arbalest mastery, and then shoot the BFG, which will grant you 9 kills.  
  
The BFG is not crucial for success in level 08, and you will be awarded full ammo before level 09 begins, so do not be afraid to use it there.

08 - Sentinel Prime

**Difficulty 5/5**  
  
It’s time for that guy. His first phase is easy to get the hang of, but during his second wave, he has a tendency to change his behaviour from one playthrough to the other, and his inconsistency, combined with his split-second attacks and his insane damage output, will have you constantly on your toes. He’s the gatekeeper to the late game, and now it’s your turn to beat him in Ultra Nightmare.  
  
Now don’t go trying your luck without having trained extensively before. You should be able to beat him consistently in Nightmare, meaning at least 90% of the time, hopefully with more than just 10 HP remaining. That boss has a variable behaviour, but fixed patterns, and you’ve got to commit them, along with their countermeasures, to muscle memory. The good thing with him, is that you can train in nightmare, and then directly hop back in your Ultra Nightmare run to fight him once again.  
  
First phase:  

-   During his first phase, move clockwise around him, so as to always see his entire body when he drops his defense.  
      
    
-   Look at the shield. Learn its tells, and you will be able to predict its attacks. Whatever the attack, make sure you dodge them at the last moment:  
    
    -   When the shield's eyes blink: it will throw its mace straight towards you. He resets fast, so you just have time for an standard ballista or super shotgun shot. When you hear the blink, jump and dash.  
        
    -   When the shield "talks": it will slam his mace on you. This has two variants, one where he jumps (easy to dodge), one where he doesn't (harder to dodge). That's when you want to unload your rockets. When you hear the blink, double jump and double dash.  
        
    -   When the gladiator bashes its shield twice with its mace: the shield will project itself forward with a red beam attack. Easy to dodge with a dash once he hits the shield the second time.
    
      
    
-   A prowler (at 75% health), and later a hell knight (at 50% health), will be spawned. The rest will be standard fodder.  
      
    
-   Take your time, clean the fodder if there’s too much around, but don't lose him from your sight. You want to end the fight with as much health and armour as possible.  
      
    
-   Be careful what you target with your lock-on burst. You may inavertedly target a fodder in front of, or behind the gladiator.  
      
    
-   A very effective method, but a VERY inconsistent one (it can work perfectly in one playthrough and not at all in the next one), is to wait five meters in front of him, and shoot him with the super shotgun as soon as he attacks. It MAY (again, very inconsistent) directly stagger him and leave him open for reprisal. You can use this method again and again, so long as it works. What determines whether he will be "receptive" to this method or not is, as far as I have been able to observe, pure randomness.

  
Second phase:  

-   NEVER EVER even for a second lose him from your sight. Whenever you chainsaw or glorykill something, do so while looking in his direction. Every second during which he attacksm that you do not see coming, is an additional chance you’ll get hit hard, which will likely lead to panic and bad decisions.  
      
    
-   His standard attacks are very hard to dodge on the ground, but are mostly harmless if you're in the air. Practice hard. When you see him throw his maces around, jump and dodge sideways. Double jump a little later, so as to maximise your air time. Land after his second mace throw to replenish your dash, then use it sideways twice when he throws his third attack.  
      
    
-   When he lifts his shield up, you may or may not hear the typical audio cue signalling an imminent attack. If you do not hear it, he will just wander around, seemingly aimlessly, for a couple of seconds. If you do hear the "blink", it means one of two things:  
    
    -   If he is closing in aggressively on you: he is preparing a close melee attack, which you want to run away from at all costs. Do not jump, stay on the ground and dash away as fast as you can until he drops his shield and resumes his standard attacks. Alternatively, you can prepare for his attack by readying your energy shield chaingun, which will block all his attacks.  
        
    -   If he is walking towards the middle of the arena: once he reaches the centre, he will erect two walls around you, and harass you with sinusoidal energy beams. Pick your chaingun and shoot, while trying your best to dodge the waves (they are harder to dodge than they appear). Once the energy walls dim and the waves stop coming, prepare yourself to double dash sideways at a millisecond’s notice. Again, practice this extensively in nightmare.
    
      
    
-   Your rocket launcher is once again your best friend. Lock-on burst him as much as possible, while refraining from attacking at the end of his attack sequences, shortly before he goes defensive again. The ballista-super shotgun quick-swap is a great alternative if you run out of rockets.  
      
    
-   The more you practice, the more manageable he will become. However, another factor will always escape your grasp if you do not control it as soon as possible: the prowlers he spawns. Up to two of them may be spawned during this phase. They can sometimes teleport behind you and cut you down, either killing you or making you panic, which will kill you anyway. They can also teleport right in front of you, and attempt to stop your rockets with their faces. Whenever a prowler appears, kill it as soon as possible. You may whip out the BFG and shoot at the wall behind the gladiator in order to kill everything he spawns, deal some damage to him (but not much), and not get the damage reflected by his defensive stance.  
      
    
-   If he approaches you, run like hell and try your best to dodge his incoming attacks. If you’re lucky and a fodder happens to loiter about, you can chainsaw it. Remember, dashing only once and waiting for the cooldown allows you to move faster than double-dashing, but it takes some practice.  
      
    
-   If you find yourself out of health, flame belch and fuel, do not forget the blood punch, which does a great job at refilling your health. In fact, your systematic combo „flame belch + chainsaw“ should be extended to „flame belch + chainsaw + blood punch“ just for this fight. Just in case.

  
  

Fortress of doom

Don’t get caught your pants down. Your crib is under attack. Be sure to get a blood punch charge for the next level on all that fodder.

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 hell knight, 1 cyber mancubus, 1 marauder**  
  
Feed the knight rockets, and freezepunch the cyber mancubus. If you don’t have blood punch available, chaingun it from a distance.  
  
After opening the door, dodge the marauder's attacks until you can see and shoot the cacodemon (it may spawn left or right). Afterwards, the marauder is yours.  
  
Inside the city, after climbing up the wall and reaching a bridge, a mancubus will show itself at the door. Freeze it, you don’t have enough room to dodge effectively.  
  
Grab the codex entry, you will need 6 for a challenge. Check your map regularly, and just use the fast travel at the end of the level if you're missing some.  
  
  

09 - 02

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 hell knight, 1 prowler, 1 archvile**  
  
This fight is relatively easy if you know what to do, but it still can degenerate. If you don't know how to deal with an archvile, this arena will most likely be your grave.  
  
The most important thing to do is to silence the archvile. Go check the entry in the section **Preparations - Killing super heavies**. Done? Alright, here's what to do.  
  
Traverse the arena as fast as possible, and climb the stairs. Up there, behind the statue, is the most likely (random) spawn location of the hell knight, kill it quickly with a lock-on burst. If it's a prowler, super shotgun it.  
  
From up there, you will soon see the archvile spawning from three (again, random) locations. Either to your left or to your right (across the gap, under an arch), or straight ahead to the other side of the arena, at the same height. If it spawns close to you, engage as advised in the dedicated section of the guide stated above.  
  
If it spawns on the other side of the arena, rush to it, but not before having shot two rockets its way, one to destroy its shield and one to stun it. Take your time, do not miss, or it will cost you. Once you reach it, engage as usual.  
  
If you did not kill the prowler and/or the knight, be careful about your surroundings, dodge accordingly, but remember that the archvile is the absolute priority.  
  
  

09 - 03

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 doom hunter, 1 pain elemental**  
  
At this point in the game, your main weapons are already maxed up, you do not desperately need another WP. It is unwise to trigger this secret encounter, as it has the potential to degenerate, and you may not be able to complete it. But if you must, here's how it will unfold.  
  
The pain elemental's presence means that you will not necessarily be better off hiding in the building. Besides, all the time you hide is also some time you do not shoot at things. First, feed the cacodemon a charged arbalest shot, then the same to the pain elemental, followed by a triple rocket salvo. An ice grenade can help with that. Then deal with the doom hunter the regular way, except a bit faster than usual. If you're out of rockets, the chaingun is a viable but dangerous option against the first phase, and a very effective one against the second. Alternatively, you can chainsaw the fodder demon around to get your ammo back.  
  
You may want to try to glorykill the pain elemental. You need to do this three times for a challenge. You will really put yourself in more danger than it's worth, so I would advise not to attempt this challenge at all. There will be 4 mandatory pain elementals, plus one from this encounter, plus two in the slayer gate. If you really want to do the challenge, you can also kill the cacodemon, try to glorykill the pain elemental, hide from the doom hunter until the timer runs out, then try again until you get three different glory kills. Three rockets followed by an uncharged ballista is a good, moderately reliable way to stagger it without too much danger.

09 - 05

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 dread knight, 1 prowler, 1 doom hunter, 2 cyber mancubi, 1 pain elemental**  
  
That’s another very hard fight, in a relatively small arena with little cover and unrelenting pressurers, like the dread knight and the pain elemental. Here's a strategy that requires a tight execution, and that you will have to practice before jumping into Ultra Nightmare. The beginning sequence is easy to mess up, so remain focused.  
  
First, you want to take out the cyber mancubus in front of you. Jump ahead, dash twice and reel in with the meat hook, while you throw an ice grenade. Blood punch it, shoot your super shotgun once, and it will fall. The second cyber mancubus will spawn where you entered in the arena, upstairs. Don't stay static for too long, the dread knight will be burning your  
  
If you want to play as safely as possible and want to fire the BFG, now is the time. Just when the pain elemental spawns, shooting into the air will only leave the doom hunter to deal with.  
  
From your vantage point, the pain elemental will spawn up in the air, to the right of the entrance. You can't lock-on burst it, it is too far away and 90% of the time you will target the lost souls it throws at you. Instead, my favourite method is to do something you'll probably never do again: quick-swap between the ballista and the scoped heavy cannon.  
  
Right after killing the first cyber mancubus, charge a ballista shot, aim at the pain elemental, shoot, switch to the cannon, aim, shoot, then land the second charged ballista shot. It's not that hard, except for the dread knight and other fodder demons that will already be breathing down your neck, so try to pull off as much as you can while moving. Do not hesitate to shoot your ballista twice and the heavy cannon last, or the opposite, depending on how well you manage the quick swap. This is where the combat gets most unpredictable, I am currently working on the strategy to increase its reliability.  
  
Once the pain elemental is out of the picture, focus the cyber mancubus that should be hiding in the corridor of the arena's entrance. Swap to frag grenades, and the rocket launcher. Approach it and throw a grenade and three rockets. Then back away immediately by falling down below, and take the jump pad back up. Throw your second frag grenade and another rocket volley, and you should almost certainly have killed it.  
  
Continue down the stairs to the side opposite of where you just came from, grab the monkey bar and land up on the platform with the lever you need to activate later. From up there, shoot your ballista at the cacodemon, and stay mobile between there and where you killed the first cyber mancubus. The dread knight will arrive soon, your ice grenade should be ready again. Feed it chaingun bullets, or three rockets and a knee to the jaw. Be mindful of the gargoyles and the prowler.  
  
NOTE: When repeatedly training this arena, the cacodemon may stop spawning! It is a minor hindrance in this arena, but keep it in mind.  
  
The doom hunter will be the only one left. If you have followed the instructions successfully, you may engage it as usual. Otherwise, be advised that it spawn once three of the initial heavy demons are dead (you do NOT want to face the second cyber mancubus AND the doom hunter at the same time). Once it's done, use the remaining fodder to get back to full health and ammo, because the next fight will also be a difficult one.

09 - Taras Nabad, part 2

09 - 06

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 2 mancubi, 6 whiplashes, 11 prowlers, 1 tyrant, 1 pain elemental**  
  
At this point, there is absolutely no valid, rational reason to do this gate. It’s an almost nonexistent payoff for a huge risk. And you’ll answer, sure but doing the game in Ultra Nightmare is the same, there’s absolutely no valid, rational reason to do it, and the payoff is almost nonexistent. And you know what... you’re absolutely right. So let’s get to it:  
  
The archvile and the pain elemental will be your first worries. Freeze the archvile, forcefeed it rockets and bullets, and do the same for the pain elemental. The army of prowler will be next, and even though the super shotgun is very effective at killing them individually, you might need something stronger. However, anything stronger will require a sacrifice in survivability. Pick your poison.  
  
Then, the whiplashes will invade. Rockets are still the best way to deal with them. The rest of the gate should not be that problematic.  
  
  

09 - 07

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 hell knight, 1 whiplash, 7 prowlers, 1 carcass, 1 baron, 1 archvile**  
  
Rush towards the middle of the map, and you will find a carcass and a hell knight to your left. Throw an ice grenade at them, but be aware that the carcass will spawn an energy barrier in front of you. Kill the carcass with a point blank super shotgun shot. Get away from the knight and feed it three rockets. The whiplash will not be far, locate it and repeat the triple rockets.  
  
The baron will spawn, and prowlers will accompany it. Kill the prowlers before engaging the baron. Be mindful with the usual "chaingun 'till it dies" approach, the arena is small and filled with dangerous fodder demons, ready to ruin your day. You may attempt to microwave beam the baron, but remain careful. The archvile spawns very last, and is relatively isolated. Locate it quickly, harass it with everything you have. Dodge the fire attacks and interrupt its attempts at spawning reinforcements. You may use a BFG shot if you don’t feel confident. Try to have your blood punch ready for the next arena.  
  
  

09 - 08

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 marauder**  
  
This secret encounter is very hard, but has its use. The next fight will be very difficult, and you want to be fully stocked for it. You can trigger the secret encounter as many times as you want, and just jump around the arena with the marauder chasing you, while you repeatedly harvest armour, health, ammo and blood punch charge from the three zombies belonging to the encounter. It can be a bit risky (be especially careful with the dog), but it can pay off big time.  
  
The problem with wanting to complete this secret encounter, is that it can put you in a very bad position for the next fight. There will be no fodder demon to exploit afterwards, and if the marauder left you half dead, you will most certainly die. Additionally, the timing is pretty tight, so without a solid execution, time will run out. Just be sure to engage the marauder far away from the zombies that spawn alongside him. If you run out of time, just trigger the encounter like described in the previous paragraph.  
  
  

09 - 09

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 dread knight, 1 whiplash, 3 prowlers, 1 cyber mancubus, 1 marauder**  
  
Very tough fight, that can degenerate very quickly. You may reduce the difficulty slightly by baiting an already present prowler to teleport to you before entering the arena, on the broken column covering the titan.  
  
The cyber mancubus will be the most immediate threat to your wellbeing. Approach it with the usual freeze-punch-super shotgun combo. Then run towards the other end of the map, and take the jumper, behind the floating platform with the monkey bar. While in the air, strike the cacodemon down with an arbalest shot.  
  
Land on the platform, and try to get the dread knight and the whiplash with lock-on bursts. You should be constantly jumping between that platform and the high ground in the building next to it, the dread knight, the whiplash and the marauder will have trouble following you, while you eliminate the prowlers one after another. Once it is done, the isolated marauder is to be engaged as usual.  
  
Get stocked up on the remaining fodder demons, your blood punch will come in handy later.  
  
  

09 - 10

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 prowlers, 3 pinkies, 1 pain elemental**  
  
Blood punch the pinky immediately in front of you, and ignore the two others for now. Run laps around the arena until you've dealt with the pain elemental and the prowlers, then freeze and kill the pinkies. Again, use the fodder demons to replenish your ammo, health and blood punch. Alternatively, you may completely bypass this segment and dash ahead to the next arena. Be aware that the pain elemental will be stalking you if you keep it alive, but you can snipe it from your new distant vantage point.  
  
  

09 - 11

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 cacodemons, 3 prowlers, 2 spectres, 1 pain elemental**  
  
This fight is pretty intense, and can quickly degenerate. First of all, feed an arbalest charged shot and a lock-on salvo (in that order) to the pain elemental. Then, go right and you will run into a spectre head on. A rocket and a point blank super shotgun shot are very effective at killing them.  
  
Afterwards, run around and kill what you see. This fight is very unpredictable, so be ready for anything. Do not underestimate the prowlers. Don't forget about your panic ice grenade. You will find that the frag grenades with the scatter bomb upgrade do wonders against prowlers and spectres, if they are grouped together or with fodder demons.  
  
Alternatively, you can kill the pain elemental, and retreat back to the elevator shaft. No guarantee on the demons behaviour though, do at your own risk.  
  
Alternatively, you can jump down a level where the pain elemental spawns, and camp in the room where the crystal is. The demons will come at you one by one, but beware of the prowlers that can still teleport behind you. If you’re overwhelmed, throw an ice grenade. If you want to go back up to finish the job, or to pick the SP, you can always jump down, but know that the fall damage will tick twice, and you’ll take roughly 50 damage.

09 - 12

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 whiplashes, 2 prowlers, 1 carcass, 1 spectre**  
  
Try to get the carcass first. If you don’t succeed before the whiplashes arrive, freeze everything and make everything explode. The arena is small, but pretty good for running around.  
  
  

09 - 13

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 dread knight, 1 prowler, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
Get the cyber mancubus first with the usual freeze bloodpunch super shotgun. Don’t hesitate to run from the dread knight if you feel you’re losing control.  
You’ll get another master token after this fight.  
  
  

09 - 14

**Difficulty 1/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 hell knight, 1 dread knight, 1 whiplash, 4 prowlers, 1 pinky, 2 barons, 1 pain elemental, 1 archvile**  
  
It’s time to have the time of your life! You may use the crucible on every heavy demon and three prowlers (not all four), and you’ll get out of this fight with 3 crucible charges.  
  
Melee attacking an archvile is never a clever thing to do, and even with the crucible it remains extremely dangerous. Be sure to freeze it before engaging it, and everything will be fine.  
  
Grappling the pain elemental with the meat hook, in order to slash it later with the crucible, is choice of approach that doesn't generally end well. Find other ways to get at its height.

10 - 01

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 2 cyber mancubi**  
  
The arachnotron will come down the stairs to greet you. Take out the cyber mancubus in the middle with the usual combo. Engage the second cyber mancubus with the microwave beam once you've cleared up the fodder demons around, or replenish the blood punch by farming fodder around with the super shotgun. The cacodemon will spawn last.  
  
  
  

10 - 02

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 prowler, 1 pinky, 1 carcass**  
  
You’ll be greeted by all three demons at the same time. An ice grenade will greatly help.  
  
  
  

10 - 03

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 whiplash, 1 prowler, 1 cyber mancubus, 1 tyrant, 1 baron**  
  
Walk in front of the door, in order to trigger the tyrant spawn, then grab the onslaught powerup and set up your chaingun. When looking straight at the door, in front of it: take out the tyrant in front, the cacodemon up behind you, then the mancubus to your right, then the whiplash to your left, then the prowler somewhere around you. It’s possible to get all five of them with the powerup.  
The full armour pickup is only accessible once you’ve opened the big door.  
After jumping down, a baron will spawn. Chaingun it to death like usual.

10 - 04

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 pain elementals**  
  
There are two safe spots where you can stay more or less indefinitely, as shown in the picture. The first eye will be alone. Once you kill it, a gargoyle will spawn every 10 secondes on each safe spot, alternatively. Once the second eye destroyed, two pain elementals will spawn one after another. Use the charged arbalest – lock-on burst combo. The third and fourth eye do not bring anymore surprise. The gargoyles will stop spawning once all four eyes are destroyed.  
  
You can avoid dealing with the pain elementals by destroying the first eye, then shooting one charged arbalest shot into each of the three remaining eyes, without destroying them. Once you've shot all three eyes once, you can destroy them in quick succession, rush to the brain, destroy it, and advance.  
  
  
  

10 - 05

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
2 prowlers, 2 spectres**  
  
Play around with the crushers, and finish the challenge if you feel like it. For the near future however, it is more important to make sure to fully stock up on hit points and ammo, and to refill the blood punch.  
  
Beware, you will not always manage to crush both spectres with the crusher, do not get rushed by the second one you didn’t kill.  
  
  
  

10 - 06

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 hell knight**  
  
Turning back after activating the encounter, a zombie will be to your left, and a knight will come from the right. Kill the zombie, then give yourself space to shoot three rockets at the incoming knight. The microwave beam option is tempting, but you'll likely not kill the knight in time for the challenge.  
  
  
  

10 - 07

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 hell knight, 1 dread knight, 1 whiplash, 1 prowler, 1 carcass, 1 cyber mancubus, 1 archvile**  
  
This is a hard fight, that you can either dominate or be dominated by, depending heavily on the demons spawn location. The spawn order is fixed.  
  
When you climb up the wall, take the jump pad in front of you, and wait for the dread knight to climb up the stairs from the other side of the room. Once you kill it, a carcass and a whiplash will spawn, not always at the same spot. Make sure to replenish all your hit points before killing them. Once they fall, a cacodemon, a hell knight and a cyber mancubus will spawn. The cacodemon always spawns right above the jump pad you took at the beginning.  
  
The archvile spawns when you've killed two of the previous three demons. The hell knight is the least threatening to leave alive, once you shift your focus towards the archvile. If you need the ice grenade to kill the cyber mancubus (see if you can't chainsaw it), wait for it to cool down before killing the cacodemon. Use that recovery time to find and kill the prowler. Once it is ready again, kill the cacodemon, and engage the archvile with the ice grenade and the crucible.  
  
You may use the BFG if you feel overwhelmed. You’ll find ammo on this arena.  
  
  

10 - 08

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 mancubus, 1 pinky, 1 totem, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
You will meet a mancubus in a large corridor. Kill it, and use fodder to get to full hit points and blood punch for the next arena. Do not lose too many hit points.  
  
There’s a master token behind a fissured wall, to the right of the first crusher spot.  
  
First thing to do is to find the totem and destroy it. Do not get distracted, or try to pull early kills, focus on the totem. You need to traverse the arena and jump on the high ground to your right, then run back to the other end of the arena by jumping on the platforms on the way. You might get harassed by the arachnotron or the cyber mancubus on your way, prepare an ice grenade just in case. Once the totem is destroyed, you may engage the demons the usual way, with the cyber mancubus at top priority.  
  
Alternatively, if you want to not take any risk, you may just shoot the BFG into the room upon entry, removing all heavy demons at once.  
  
  

10 - 09

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 baron**  
  
A baron will spawn from the right side. Have an ice grenade ready for it, and chaingun it to death.  
  
This encounter is easily dealt with. You can exploit it by leaving a zombie alive, and harvesting the rest for resources. You can even leave it there and come back to it after segment 10 - 10. By now, you should get 80 bullets when chainsawing demons, which is just enough to kill the frozen baron, next time you trigger the encounter.  
  
  

10 - 10

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 whiplash, 1 marauder**  
  
You’ll get jumped on by a marauder, and shortly after a whiplash. You can have your first weapons exchange with the marauder, then switch to the rocket launcher for the whiplash. Be careful, there is not much space to navigate in.  
  
Do not forget to grab the crucible charge underneath, if you've used it previously.  
  

10 - 11

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 hell knight, 1 dread knight, 1 whiplash, 1 carcass, 2 doom hunters, 1 spectre, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
Enter the arena from the left door, and walk on. you will meet a spectre, that you can super shotgun at point blank. A whiplash will have spawned at the same time in the middle, and be to your right or behind you. Shoot it with your rocket launcher, and immediately after it dies, a carcass will have spawned at the same spot. Kill it with another lock-on burst, to be 100% sure it is dead.  
  
Go forward by still hugging the left side of the arena, and lock-on burst the hell knight that will have spawned to the far end of the arena. You will arrive at the cyber mancubus, that you can kill with the usual combo. You want to hit fast, and retreat just as fast, because killing the hell knight will have triggered the two doom hunters to spawn.  
  
The dread knight will spawn at the same spot as the hell knight, you may engage directly or fall back to the entrance of the arena, if you are being pressured too hard by the doom hunters. At this point, the fight will be straightforward. Be sure to practice this strategy once or twice, as it requires a tight execution. Be wary, the cyber mancubus may hide behind obstacles, do not waste your ice grenade.  
  
Don't forget to grab the crucible charge if you need it. If you have not yet killed two demons with the crucible for the challenge, you can kill a fodder with it, provided you end the level with three charges.  
  
Be extra careful one last time with the crushers, on your way to the back of the statue. The fire can kill you in two seconds.

11 - 01

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
3 cacodemons, 1 pain elemental**  
  
Right at the beginning, you can blood punch the two zombies in front of you, in order to advance the first achievement of the level. You should now have both health for blood and armour for blood crystal upgrades, which makes blood punch recharging easy. Just focus on taking as little damage as possible. Do not take too much risk to advance this challenge, there will be other opportunities later.  
  
The pain elemental will spawn at the end of the main bridge. Two cacodemons will spawn when you reach the first pillar to the right, one will spawn at the second pillar.  
  
  

11 - 02

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
2 pain elementals**  
  
Take them out the usual way. Be careful not to target the lost souls with the rocket launcher.  
  
  

11 - 03

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 revenant, 1 shield soldier, 1 prowler, 1 carcass**  
  
A straightforward battle, put the ice grenade and the frag grenade to good use.  
  
  

11 - 04

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 revenant, 1 mancubus, 2 whiplashes, 2 prowlers, 1 doom hunter, 1 baron, 1 pain elemental**  
  
Get ready to rocket the mancubus in front of you, but try not to shoot into the two zombies in front of it. A revenant will spawn to the right, take it out the way you want. The baron will spawn next, folowed closely by the pain elemental. The doom hunter will spawn last, accompanied by two whiplashes. The prowler will spawn once you destroy the doom hunter's sled.  
  
You can slash the baron with the crucible if you feel like it, and backtrack to collect the crucible charge. Alternatively, you can grab the overdrive powerup and freeze chaingun it to death. Be very careful about your surroundings though, don't get killed by gargoyles.  
  
Once you destroy the doom hunter's sled, you can leave it be and focus on blood-punching duos of fodder demons.  
  
Stock up on ammo for next fight, and have a blood punch ready.  
  
  

11 - 05

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 hell knight, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
A knight will spawn to your right, a cyber mancubus to your left. Go deal with the cyber mancubus first, then turn around and chaingun the hell knight. Try to preserve your rockets.  
  
  

11 - 06

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 revenant, 1 dread knight, 1 carcass, 1 marauder, 1 archvile**  
  
Deal with the arachnotron first below, then the carcass. Be careful of the fodder demons that surround it, throw a frag grenade in before engaging. The revenant and the dread knight do not represent that big a threat if you keep moving around, try to get back up to full health before killing them. Kill the dread knight last, because its death triggers the archvile spawn. The marauder will come last.  
  
Get a blood punch ready before advancing.

11 - 07

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 revenant, 1 shield soldier, 1 carcass, 2 spectres, 2 cyber mancubi**  
  
When you are entering in the elevator room, the carcass will be spawning in front of you, the two mancubi left and right, and the first spectre behind you. The cited demons spawn when the elevator first arrives at the top, independently of whether you are aboard or not. If you jump from it mid-run (for example, to pick the hidden SP behind the elevator), the demons will spawn and move around, giving you much less control over the battle.  
  
DISCLAIMER: If you are training in Nightmare mode, be aware that upon checkpoint reloading, the revenant, the arachnotron and some fodder demons will not appear! You may train in real situation only once. If you want additional tries, you will have to reset the level. Be extremely careful with the following strategy.  
  
Go straight ahead, run to a launchpad and take care of the carcass with the super shotgun grappling hook. Focus either cyber mancubus afterwards, with the usual combo. Then run back to the platform where you killed the carcass, if you haven't lost any armour point yet, the armour points you've gained with the super shotgun meat hook action will be enough to refill your blood punch. You can engage the second cyber mancubus directly without the ice grenade, or play safe and kill the other demons first. Alternatively, you can kill the cyber mancubus with the microwave beam, just make sure your surroundings are clear before doing so.  
  
Alternatively, you may enter from the front, grapple the carcass above, then break the wall and advance, ignoring the rest of the demons. This is a vicious fight in a tight arena with lots of dangerous demons that can ruin your day in the blink of an eye, there is no shame in dodging this encounter altogether.  
  
  

11 - 08

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
2 prowlers, 1 dread knight**  
  
There are two eyes. Get to a quadrant where there is no eye to prey on you, and deal with the fodder and the prowler coming at you. Destroy one eye, and a dread knight will spawn.  
You’ll find a crucible charge at the end.  
  
  

11 - 09

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 2 cacodemon, 1 revenant, 3 whiplashes, 3 prowlers, 1 carcass, 1 doom hunter, 1 totem, 1 tyrant, 1 baron**  
  
This fight is hard due to the swarm of fodder demons roaming around, run wide laps around the map for safety. When the tyrant spawns, either use the crucible, or leave it for the end of the fight. Alternatively, you may microwave the tyrant as soon as it spawns, and it will stop mid-jump and fall down in the pit it came from. This strategy costs one plasma ammo instead of one crucible charge, for the same effect.  
  
Take care of the carcass, the prowlers and the whiplash that spawn. Afterwards, the arachnotron, the baron, the revenant and a cacodemon will spawn. The doom hunter spawns last, with the last cacodemon. Crucible the baron if you don't feel confident. There's enough fuel canisters around to chainsaw one heavy demon, preferably the arachnotron.  
  
You may use the BFG if you want, there’s ammo on the map.

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 revenant, 1 hell knight, 1 dread knight, 1 mancubus, 2 whiplashes, 1 cyber mancubus, 4 drones**  
  
First things first, there’s a crucible charge after the very first portal jump. Walk around the building to find it.  
  
You can first take down a drone or two. The hell knight will spawn below, in the middle, wait for it and kill it as soon as possible because shortly after, the cyber mancubus will spawn at the same spot. Meanwhile, a revenant will have joined the fray. The dread knight and the whiplashes will spawn afterwards. At the end, the mancubus. You will get pressured hard in this arena because the demons spawn quickly one after the other, don’t hesitate to run away but always mind the position of the mancubi.  
  
You may use a BFG shot if threatened.  
  
  

12 - 02

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 cacodemon, 1 pain elemental, 3 drones**  
  
Wipe the fodder out and get your arbalest. Shoot at the cacodemon (it will spawn left of the pain elemental), then at the pain elemental, with a rocket launcher finish. Be sure to move a lot while doing so, the drones will beat you up otherwise. Clear the drones with an ice grenade and your favourite headshooting technique.  
  
  

12 - 03

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 cyber mancubus, 2 drones**  
  
Combo the cyber mancubus as usual, and kill the drones the usual way too. Nothing special.  
  
  

12 - 04

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 dread knight, 6 prowlers, 1 doom hunter, 1 baron, 4 drones**  
  
Once you break the grate, grapple the drone in front of you and kill it. Then run forward left, following the left wall of the arena and you will find the totem. Afterwards, deal with the arachnotron and some drones, and the doom hunter will appear with some prowlers. The dread knight should appear soon after.  
  
In the next room, you’ll face some fodder, a baron and a prowler.  
  
  

12 - 05

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
2 cacodemons, 1 revenant, 1 cyber mancubus, 1 marauder, 2 drones**  
  
When you land in the next arena, go left and you will see a drone and a revenant. Deal with both and a cyber mancubus will spawn. Afterwards, the marauder will spawn. Standard, low pressure fight if you handle it well.  
  
After activating the portal,, two cacodemons will spawn far away.  
  
  

12 - 06

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 mancubus, 1 dread knight, 1 pain elemental, 3 drones, 1 archvile**  
  
The pain elemental will spawn first, and the archvile soon after. The dread knight and the mancubus will arrive once you kill the archvile, independently of the status of the pain elemental.  
  
After the fight, you can take the celestial portal towards the left, or towards the right. The guide will go left first.

12 - 07

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 2 revenants, 1 dread knight (later), 2 mancubi, 2 whiplashes, 1 prowler, 1 totem, 2 cyber mancubi, 1 tyrant, 2 drones**  
  
This fight is not overly hard, but you can lose control very fast and die in the blink of an eye if you get too greedy or impatient. A lot of things will be thrown at you at the same time, but the arena has a lot of features that allow you to run in circles in relative safety.  
  
The first thing you want to do is, as always, to destroy the totem. You’ll find it when you follow the ledge to the left after landing. It is located after a monkey bar pointing outwards. After that, go up the stairs, and confront whatever is waiting for you with the rocket launcher (most likely a hell knight and/or a whiplash). Frag grenades are especially good there, because heavy demons will often be grouped in narrow passages or stairs.  
  
The tyrant only spawns after you have taken down 2-3 heavy demons. There will only be one mancubus at the same time, and only one cyber mancubus at the same time. The two cyber mancubi and the tyrant spawn at the same location, in the middle of the map. You can take down the first cyber mancubus the usual way, and the second one with the chainsaw.  
  
The tyrant is pretty much harmless as long as you don’t run into it and you are running safely around the edge of the arena. Again, don’t be greedy and everything should be fine. Do not hesitate to fire a BFG shot if you panic. There is a full health pickup in the middle of the arena, but don’t rush mindlessly to it, or it might cause more harm than good.  
  
The dread knight will be waiting for you upon arrival after taking the right celestial portal.  
  
  

12 - 08

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 whiplash, 1 doom hunter, 1 spectre**  
  
This encounter is made much easier by using the destroyer blade. Fully charge it once you activate the nest, release it at waist-height, and you'll only have to deal with the remaining doom hunter.  
  
  

12 - 09

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
2 cacodemons, 2 hell knights, 1 revenant, 2 shield soldiers, 4 whiplashes, 2 prowlers, 2 cyber mancubi, 2 barons**  
  
Just like the previous arena, this fight is not overly hard, so long as you play safe and smart.  
You’ll first have to deal with some prowlers, whiplashes, a hell knight and a cyber mancubus. The second cyber mancubus spawns only after the first one has died.  
  
One cacodemon will spawn in company of a baron and a whiplash. After some further kills, one additional cacodemon will spawn in company of an additional baron, independently of the status of the previous baron. You may crucible the barons at will. If you feel like you need it, fire the BFG.  
  
Don’t forget to pick the crucible charge afterwards.  
  
  

12 - 10

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 hell knight, 2 drones**  
  
There will be a couple demons on the way to the boss. Try not to use rockets, and to get to the boss fight with full health and armour.  
  
Alright, the Khan Maykr. It’s a horrible boss, until you get the grip of her patterns, the arena’s layout, and the tactics to use, then she becomes the most predictable, and less run-killing boss of the game. Don't let it go to your head however, do not underestimate this fight. It’s been said a hundred times already, let’s say it once more: DO NOT RUSH. Take your time, be patient, let an opportunity slip if it is too dangerous to exploit. If you have to let her go and refill her health bar so that you can do the same on your side, let it be so. It has never been easier to refill your own health bar.absta  
  
Here’s how to do it:  

-   First, as very often in this game, the rocket launcher will be your best friend. Two lock-on bursts, followed by either a well placed standard ballista shot, or a relatively close up super shotgun shot, will do the trick. Hook her, reel in, punch her, and start again. Alternatively of course, your best friend the BFG can deal roughly 50% damage while flying through the air, and a shot can stagger her directly if it hits her. Keep your BFG shots for the latter phases of the fight, as this is where she will be the most dangerous (most notably due to the scorched ground).  
      
    
-   If you have the chrono strike rune, the best, safest and most reliable way to headshoot drones is with the super shotgun. Grapple, reel in, shoot slightly below the middle of the face, and you'll get health, ammo and 30 armour. At worst, you will stagger the drone, in which case you will just have to shoot again. Be mindful of the status of your rune though, so as to not be surprised if the game goes at real speed when reeling in.  
      
    
-   If she goes 5-6 seconds without taking damage, she’ll regenerate her hit points. If she does, clear your mind, do not insist. Deal with the situation as if it was a reboot, and be at peace with it. Go fetch some ammo or some health, and start again properly.  
      
    
-   You can camp without too much problem in this fight. Make sure to fulfill three criterias: you’re not stepping on scorched ground, you’ve got something (even something small) between you and the Khan, and you’re close to a roof to jump on if she decides to use her sun beam. You can stay still for a little time in order to make your chrono strike rune cool down. If you get aggressed by a drone, jump on it with the super shotgun. If you don’t have the time to aim for the head, a point blank super shotgun body shot can stagger, and even kill them.  
      
    
-   The high grounds will never be scorched, and you can jump pretty safely on them to attack the Khan, and to get some small cover from the drones. Just keep in mind that you’re making yourself an ideal target for her projectile attacks that way.  
      
    
-   You can either engage her on those high grounds, or take one of the jump pads on the edge of the arena to get some consistent air time while shooting your two triple rocket salvoes. That way, it will be easier to dodge her projectiles. She always shoots three yellow slashes, and one purple BFG-like bubble. Be sure to always have a dash ready for the last one.  
      
    
-   Ideally, take a jump pad to propel yourself upwards before grappling her for a blood punch. That way, you’ll have much more aerial control if you fail your execution.  
      
    
-   It goes without saying, but anyway: keep your eye on her, but don’t lose sight of what’s happening on the ground. Drones and scorched grounds can be more dangerous than her attacks if you don’t pay them attention.  
      
    
-   Respect the scorched ground. If you "think" you are stepping on it, you are stepping on it. Double-jumping above it will not get you out of it, you need to move to higher ground or leave it completely.

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 1 hell knight, 2 revenants, 2 mancubi, 1 shield soldier, 2 whiplashes, 2 prowlers, 1 carcass, 1 doom hunter, 1 cyber mancubus, 1 tyrant, 1 baron, 1 pain elemental**  
  
This is a very nice arena, with plenty of space to navigate everywhere, and lots of cover. The fight can get messy, do not lose your cool now. The spawn order is hard to keep track of, but is roughly the following:  
Arachnotron, cacodemon, revenants, carcass.  
Then cyber mancubus, mancubi, knight.  
Then baron, whiplash, prowlers, pain elemental.  
Then tyrant.  
Then finally doom hunter.  
  
Feel free to chainsaw the cyber mancubus, and to crucible the tyrant.

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 2 revenants, 2 mancubi, 1 prowler, 1 pinky, 1 carcass**  
  
You’ll get a mancubus, a prowler, an arachnotron, a pinky. Up next, one storey above, a knight, a carcass and a revenant.  
  
  

13 - 03

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 1 revenant, 1 dread knight, 2 mancubi, 1 shield soldier, 1 whiplash, 1 prowler, 1 pinky, 1 carcass, 1 totem, 1 cyber mancubus**  
  
Once you enter the building after jumping along nacelles, go straight forward and kill the two fodder battling each other. Refrain from mindlessly killing fodder. Behind them, a prowler will spawn. Approach it (and kill it), and a revenant will spawn. Kill it too. Once it’s done, kill fodder until the totem spawns, right from whence the revenant arrived. Try to take out the shielded soldier before the totem spawns, as he becomes a beast once buffed. Destroy the totem immediately.  
  
You’ll then have to deal with a pinky right in front of you, blood punch it. Do not go upstairs yet! Go left, from whence the pinky just came, and you’ll face a hell knight and a whiplash. Once they are dead and you’ve cleaned up the fodder, go upstairs to face a dread knight and a mancubus (which would have spawned alongside the hell knight earlier if you had gone upstairs sooner). Behind the corner, an arachnotron and a cyber mancubus will be waiting.  
  
  

13 - 04

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 2 revenants, 1 marauder**  
  
Be sure to grab the megasphere before going up. After climbing up the wall, you want to circle arount the building to find the access, the ramp to your right immediately triggers the next encounter. The fight looks deceivingly easy, but don’t take it lightly. Lots of fodder enemies tightly packed with heavy demons, throw frag grenades from a safe distance. Beware the cacodemon, which will not spawn directly and can bite you in the behind.  
  
The second wave features another revenant, the marauder and lots of gargoyles. Be sure to keep the fodder demons count in check, as they can quickly overwhelm you.

**Difficulty 4/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 cacodemon, 3 revenants, 2 mancubi, 2 pinkies, 3 tyrants, 1 baron**  
  
There are two main ways to approach this fight. First, the safe way.  
  
You’ll have to jump to another building, where two fodder demons are infighting. Avoid them, and jump directly to the next building, where you can clear up the four fodder demons to stock up on ammo and health.  
  
Now, in the next building, you’ll be seeing a lot of demons infighting. Fortunately for you, you’re looking at them from a very advantageous vantage point From there, you can already take out, without any problem, two mancubi, one arachnotron, one revenant and one tyrant (take the tyrant out last, otherwise the other demons will focus their fire on you). Once you’re done, you can backtrack to use the two fodder demons for your chainsaw, and then enter a much easier fight.  
  
Alternatively, you can go in the hard way. Take the mancubus in front of you out, and seek cover upstairs. Kill the remaining mancubus, the revenants and the arachnotron. A baron will spawn afterwards, from your insertion point. The second wave starts only once the tyrant is dead.  
The second wave will star another arachnotron, a cacodemon, a revenant, two pinkies, and two tyrants. Once one or two of those demons die, the totem will spawn. When you’re in the lobby, go up the stairs, follow the long corridor and turn right to find the totem. Once it is destroyed, keep evading the tyrants and kill the other demons first. As usual, but more now than ever, this fight requires you to not bite more than you can chew, and to play safe.  
  
  

13 - 06

**Difficulty 3/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 2 revenants, 1 manchbus, 1 baron**  
  
Right upon getting to the next level after climbing the wall, you’ll get ambushed by a hell knight and two revenants. Take this fight very seriously, fall back below if needed.  
  
Up the stairs, you’ll be ambushed again by a mancubus, an arachnotron and a baron. Same applies, don’t hesitate to fall back.  
  
Try to lose as little hit points as possible, and conserve your ammo wisely, you will need everything you can have for the next fight. Go back to the ground level to scrounge for extra pickups.  
  
  

13 - 07

**Difficulty 5/5  
  
3 arachnotrons, 1 hell knight, 4 revenants, 1 dread knight, 1 mancubus, 1 pinky, 1 cyber mancubus, 2 pain elementals, 1 marauder, 1 archvile**  
  
This might well be the most difficult arena in the game. That is, if you want to do a run without using the BFG or the crucible at all. If not, you’ll probably notice that the game screams at you to use the BFG. If you do want to shoot your BFG, do it right at the beginning. Pass through the door to your left after the flight of stairs, and aim at the breach in the building to your right, in order to maximise flight time, to kill the two pain elementals that spawn afterwards. That way, two revenants, the marauder and the archvile will be the only ones left. You may shoot through the right door directly at the breach, but that way you may miss a couple of heavies with the tendrils. Note that the two additional revenants mentioned above spawn only when you get to the upper level.  
  
Here is a tactic suggestion if you want to avoid using the BFG. Do not enter by the left door, but by the right. Kill the mancubus right in front of you the usual way. Next, switch to the super shotgun and the ice grenade. Throw the ice grenade at the cyber mancubus and the pinky to your left, behind the podium with the BFG ammo. Blood punch the cyber mancubus and kill it with the super shotgun. If you feel extra heroic, stay a little more and blood punch the pinky (very dangerous). Then, run like hell, and get to the top level to dodge the dozens of projectiles headed your way. Once up there, find something to chainsaw if needed, and throw frag grenades at heavy demons that are starting to group up.  
  
After a couple of heavies have gone down, two pain elementals will spawn. They are a serious threat, that will require dedication to kill. Once it’s done, deal with the remaining demons before engaging the marauder that just spawned. Keep the gargoyle population low. Once he dies, the archvile spawns, which is best taken care of with the crucible.  
  
Don’t forget to get all the BFG ammo you can for the boss fight.  
  
  

13 - 08

**Difficulty 2/5  
  
1 arachnotron, 1 hell knight, 1 revenant, 1 dread knight, 1 whiplash**  
  
On the bridge below, you’ll see many demons infighting (again). First the whiplash, the arachnotron and the revenant, then the two knights. If you really, REALLY do not want to take the slightest risk so close to the end, fire a BFG shot along the bridge and everything will die.  
  
If you engage normally, try to be extra careful when dealing with them all, so as to lose as little hit points as possible. You’ll need every last bit you can conserve for the next fight. No spoil.

13 - Final sin, part 2

13 - 09

**Difficulty 5/5**  
  
It’s time to finally obtain your gold-plated suit.  
  
This boss is not very hard in itself, especially if you know what to do. However, there are lots of factors you do not have total control over, that can make the fight quickly degenerate. You won’t be allowed to be very proactive, instead you’ll have to react to what random cards the game deals you. Always play safe, do not rush, respect the boss, and you will get out of there alive and gold-clad.  
  
Just like the original icon of sin in DOOM 2, the demons spawned there are random. This means that you can get a very peaceful run where you can almost exclusively focus on the icon, or a run where you’ll have to cut down four barons and three mancubi at least. The chance for an archvile spawning in DOOM 2 was small, but not zero. In this game, no archvile can spawn.  
  
First phase:  

-   Take cover immediately by positioning yourself in front of the portal to your left, in order to dodge the icon’s punch. Take 5 seconds to look around, and deal with any heavy monster you find with the crucible. The crucible charges scattered around the arena reappear fast, so do not be afraid to slash everything taller than you.  
      
    
-   You can shoot the BFG five times in this phase. Each shot can destroy a piece of armour, so you’ll end up having to destroy only three with your conventional weapons. However, it is advised to shoot only three times and keep two shots for the next phase. Here are estimates of the amount of health of each body part:  
    
    -   Head: 8.000 - 10.000  
        
    -   Chest: 6.200 - 7.000  
        
    -   Abdomen: 4.800 - 6.500  
        
    -   Shoulder: 4.500 - 5.000  
        
    -   Forearm: 3.000 - 4.000
    
      
    
-   If you have the Unmaykr, you may want to incorporate it into your routine. The BFG deals 10.000 damage per 30 ammo, to any body part (for comparison, a blank ballista shot deals 680 damage). The Unmaykr deals 134 damage per projectile to any body part. You shoot 3 projectiles per ammo, which means 90 projectiles for 30 ammo. This means that, if you land 100% of your shots, the Unmaykr deals 12.060 damage with 30 ammo, which is 20% more ammo-effective than the BFG.  
      
    The BFG is the fastest way to tear down the icon's health, but shooting a forearm with it is clearly overkill, as you deal only 4.000 damage instead of the potential 10.000. The Unmaykr requires exposure close to the icon, and is not terribly accurate, but is more efficient than the BFG. The best way to use your ammo, meaning the best compromise between being safe and being fast (according to me), is to shoot three BFG rounds into the head and both chestplates, then to keep your BFG ammo for the second phase, where you repeat the same action, and proceed to shoot all the remaining charges scattered on the map with the Unmaykr at the shoulders and forearms, whenever he punches you.  
      
    
-   Landing BFG shots is not easy, as the icon constantly moves around. Above all, be patient, do not rush. Each shot is important. During the first seconds where you should look around you, the icon will move, until it reaches its „idle state“, where it lays both hands on the edges of the building. When you see it putting its hands there, you’ll know it’s about to be static for at least a few seconds. It will also be static when shooting at you with its magical demonic super secret forehead fire cannon. A bad time to shoot is basically the rest of the time. If he moves too much, wait.  
      
    
-   From your position in front of the portal, you’ll want to aim towards the neck with the BFG. You are almost guaranteed a hit to either the head or the breastplate. Afterwards, go to the other side of the arena, to the right jumper inside the building. You’ll find some BFG ammo. Go all the way up, then left all the way. To your right, you will find the second BFG ammo pickup. Try a shot (or not, depending on what it’s doing), pick up the ammo, then look to your right, downwards. You will see the third pickup.  
      
    
-   Once you’re done with the BFG, you will have two main ways to deal damage. The quick swap between the ballista and the super shotgun is one of them. Shoot two or three times with each weapon at the remaining pieces, then look around you to check if you’ve been followed by a knight or a cacodemon. Move around, try to read its next attack, and resume aggression.  
      
    
-   Another great way to deal damage is with the micro missiles. When mastered, killing a fodder demon with the standard bullets will empower your micro missiles for 5 seconds, during which they deal even more damage than the turret mode chaingun. Land in front of the icon, kill a fodder demon around, and unload all the micro missiles you can into it, while constantly moving around.  
      
    
-   Try to read and identify its attacks. When it fires its magical forehead cannon at you, take cover, it will stop only if you break line of sight. If you see it preparing a smash, switch to the side it is not targeting, or get closer to him, and you might dodge the attack. When it punches, move to the sides. When it prepares to shoulder bump the tower, go upstairs. When it lifts its hands up, it will consume the demons present in the arena, and replace them with new ones. The consumed demons will explode, and some areas will be covered in red electrical fields, so steer clear. When it points its palms towards you, it will incinerate a whole level, so prepare to evacuate. The chaingun's energy shield is a great way to nullify its punch damage. The trick is to have it activated quickly enough, which is pretty hard to do.  
      
    
-   If you see a heavy demon prowling around, focus it. You want that mancubus or that cacodemon out of the picture as soon as possible, so you can line your shots on the icon properly. Remember that you do not need to waste a charge on a pinky, you can blood punch them, the effect is the same.  
      
    
-   There are three jump pads right in front of the icon, up to the left and right, and down in the centre. They provide a great amount of airtime during which you can pretty safely unload your main weapons into him. Camping near them provides the additional benefits of avoiding most of his smash attacks, and to be able to escape quickly if your position gets compromised by heavy demons.

13 - Final Sin, part 3

Second phase:  

-   Get out of the way as soon as the fight starts, because the icon will engage directly with a punch.  
      
    
-   Same as before, you’ll find three BFG charges on this map. Aiming will be more difficult, as the icon will be more agitated, but keep aiming for the head and the torso for the biggest return on investment. The HP count for the head and the chest plates are higher this time.  
    
    -   Head: 9.500 - 11.500  
        
    -   Chest: 8.000 - 10.000  
        
    -   Abdomen: 4.800 - 6.500  
        
    -   Shoulder: 4.500 - 5.000  
        
    -   Forearm: 3.000 - 4.000
    
      
    
-   You will be under a bit less pressure during this phase, and you will be mostly safe from all of the icon's attacks if you remain hidden in the lower level of the map, in the middle (right under the megasphere). This is your safe spot whenever you are low on health or ammo, as demons are bound to come to you, which you can easily chainsaw or kill with the crucible.  
      
    
-   If you are running for the 100% completion, and are still short a couple of specific kills, you may safely wait in the safe spot for the right demons to spawn. In this phase, the demons spawn in specific compositions. Each time the icon recalls the demons to summon new ones, this composition will change. The possible compositions are the following:  
    
    -   Imp, revenant, baron  
        
    -   Mecha-zombie, mancubus, cyber mancubus  
        
    -   Shield soldier, carcass, arachnotron  
        
    -   Gargoyle, cacodemon, pinky  
        
    -   Soldier, whiplash, dread knight  
        
    -   Prowler, hell knight, pain elemental
    
      
    
-   You’ll get crucible charges everywhere, don’t hesitate to use it on everything in front of you, even fodder when critical on health, in order to get health back efficiently. Be mindful of your own map awareness, you never want to bump into a baron while running backwards. Always be aware of your surroundings, the heavies have precedence over the icon.  
      
    
-   The icon’s head cannon now has a laser beam retrofitted, and it will use the projectiles a bit more frequently. Its new attack will feature a meteor rain, from which you want to take immediate and prolonged shelter.  
      
    
-   The super shotgun - ballista quick-swap and the empowered micro missiles remain your main damage dealers, after you've shot all your BFG charges. Again, you should abuse the jump pads everywhere, and maximise your air time when focusing the icon. In order to maximise your survivability, your routine should look like this: enter the fight, shoot your BFG ammo, grab the charges around, get to your safe spot -> clear your immediate surroundings, heal yourself if necessary -> check if the icon is preparing an attack -> if not, take a jump pad, focus whatever on the icon -> get to your safe spot -> clear your surroundings -> take a jump pad -> etc.  
      
    
-   Do not commit to a suicide attack when you take out the last hit points of the icon. The end cutscene triggers several seconds after you kill it. Play safe until the very end, and only lift your hands from the keyboard once the cutscene starts playing.
