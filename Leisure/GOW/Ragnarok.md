# Surviving Fimbulwinter

## Early fights

Use heavy attacks,
Align yourself in front of the enemies.
Use the bouncing to your advantage.
Stun grabs are pretty effective.
Aim for the legs and move behind the enemy to start punching and kicking. 

Once you get Atreus, use his arrows to help with Stun.
