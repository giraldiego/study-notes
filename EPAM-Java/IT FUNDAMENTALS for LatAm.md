## Security
In this submodule, you have learned about:

-   basic concepts of computer security
-   the symmetric and asymmetric methods for encryption
-   TLS, its functions, and a TLS handshake

We covered this submodule without going deeper into detail. The topic is quite complex and there are even specific IT jobs dedicated solely to security: e.g., a security engineer/analyst.

### **Additional Materials**

1.  Read the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength) to learn more about password strength.
2.  Use the [Diceware website](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) to create strong passwords if you like this technique.
3.  Read the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) on public key cryptography for more details.
4.  The [TLS chapter](https://hpbn.co/transport-layer-security-tls/) from High Performance Browser Networking book is a great further reading on TLS.
## Productivity Tools
In this submodule, you have learned:

-   what a virtual machine and virtualization are
-   about different types of virtualization
-   how a hypervisor can be used to run a virtual machine
-   what cloud services are and what their main types are
-   how to interact with systems or applications using hotkeys
-   about different backup methods that can be used to manage changes in files and computer systems

### **Additional Materials**
