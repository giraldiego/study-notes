# 1. Getting Started

## Top-N recommender architecture

> Throughout this course, it's important to remember that ultimately our goal is to put the best content we can find in front of users in the form of a top-N list like this one. Our success depends on our ability to find the best top recommendations for people so it makes sense to focus on finding things people will love and not our ability to predict the items people will hate.
