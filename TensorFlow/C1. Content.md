# C1 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

Welcome to this course on going from Basics to Mastery of TensorFlow. We're excited you're here! In Week 1, you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along. To get started, check out the first video, a conversation between Andrew and Laurence that sets the theme for what you'll study...

### Learning Objectives
---
-   Monitor the accuracy of the housing price predictions
-   Analyze housing price predictions that come from a single layer neural network
-   Use TensorFlow to build a single layer neural network for fitting linear models
---

## Week 1

### A new programming paradigm
Define a model, Sequential, layers , neurons and input shape:
```python
# Build a simple Sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])
```

### Assignment

- Housing Prices _(C1W1_Assignment.ipynb)_

### Ungraded Labs

#### 1. Hello World Neural Network _(C1_W1_Lab_1_hello_world_nn.ipynb)_
- Imports
- Define the NN
- Compile with optimizer and loss
- Provide the data
- Train the model `fit()`
- Make predictions `predict()`

## Week 2
### Coding a Computer Vision Neural Network
- Load the dataset
```python
# Load the Fashion MNIST dataset
fmnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
# Load the training and test split of the Fashion MNIST dataset
(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fmnist.load_data()
```
- Split the dataset in train/dev sets
- Normalize
- Define the model (layers)
- Setup training parameters (optimizer, loss, metrics)
- Train the model
- Evaluate on the test set

### Using Callbacks to control training
```python
class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
	def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
	if(logs.get('accuracy') >= 0.6): # Experiment with changing this value
		print("\nReached 60% accuracy so cancelling training!")
		self.model.stop_training = True
```

### Assignment

- Handwriting Recognition _(C1W2_Assignment.ipynb)_

### Ungraded Labs

#### 1. Beyond Hello World, A Computer Vision Example _(C1_W2_Lab_1_beyond_hello_world.ipynb)_

- Imports
- Print TF version
- Visualize the data
- Normalize the data
- Define the model
- Compile the model (optimizer, loss, metrics)
- evaluate `evaluate()`
- Modify the model to improve results

#### 2. Callbacks _(C1_W2_Lab_2_callbacks.ipynb)_
- Define the callback function
- Add the callback during training, `fit()`


## Week 3

### Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks
- There's a lot of wasted space in each image, we need a way to distinguish important features.
- Some convolutions will change the image in such a way that certain features in the image get emphasized.
- Pooling is a way of compressing an image while simultaneously preserve the features that were highlighted by the convolution. 

### Assignment

- Improve MNIST with Convolutions _(C1W3_Assignment.ipynb)_

### Ungraded Labs

1. Improving Accuracy with Convolutions _(C1_W3_Lab_1_improving_accuracy_using_convolutions.ipynb)_
2. Exploring Convolutions _(C1_W3_Lab_2_exploring_convolutions.ipynb)_

## Week 4 - Using Real-world Images

### Image Generator
- train_generator
- validation_generator

### Designing the neural network
- 3 Conv2D with 

### Training the ConvNet
- loss='binary_crossentropy'
- optimizer=RMSprop
- We use a generator and it loads the images in batches
- Also the validation data comes from a generator
- We specify the step size for both



### Assignment

- Handling Complex Images _(C1W4_Assignment.ipynb)_

1. Load and explore the data: 
``` python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
plt.imshow()

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array
img_to_array(sample_image)
```

2. Defining the callback
```python
class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
        if logs.get('accuracy') is not None and logs.get('accuracy') > 0.999:
            print("\nReached 99.9% accuracy so cancelling training!")
            self.model.stop_training = True
```

3. Pre-processing the data

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
```

> **Deprecated:** [`tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator) is not recommended for new code. Prefer loading images with [`tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/image_dataset_from_directory) and transforming the output [`tf.data.Dataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset) with preprocessing layers. For more information, see the tutorials for [loading images](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images) and [augmenting images](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation), as well as the [preprocessing layer guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/preprocessing_layers).
