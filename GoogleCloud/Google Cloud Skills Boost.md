**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)
### Understanding regions and zones
Certain [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances "Compute Engine Docs") resources live in regions or zones. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. Each region has one or more zones.

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as _zonal_ resources. Virtual machine instances and persistent disks live in a zone. If you want to attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone.

**Note:** Learn more about regions and zones and see a complete list in Google Cloud Compute Engine's [Regions and Zones documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/).

### Finding project information

**Note:** When the `google-compute-default-region` and `google-compute-default-zone` keys and values are missing from the output, no default zone or region is set. The output includes other useful information regarding your project. Take some time to explore this in more detail.
