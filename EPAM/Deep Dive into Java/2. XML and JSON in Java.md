# Exercise

## Suffixing App

The purpose of this exercise is to teach you to design and build a Java application all by yourself, based on high-level requirements. You will have to handle command-line arguments, work with files, and use logging.

This week, you have learned about Java Logging and the most popular Java logging frameworks. Also, now you know more about the types of XML content, the meaning of well-formed and valid XML documents, and the purpose of XML namespaces. Then, we moved on to creating and transforming XML content with the help of XPath and XSLT. You have explored how to define an XML document structure using a DTD and an XML Schema.

At the end of this week, you have seen several different APIs, discovered how to create and parse XML documents, and reviewed the provided examples. So far so good!
