# Object Oriented Thinking

Welcome to a new learning week where we will continue to dive into the world of Java!

This time we are getting started with three main topics: Object-Oriented Software Design, SOLID Principles, and Programming Design Patterns.

Why would we? Well, Object-Oriented Programming took the top spot as a leading programming paradigm for some good reasons. It offers a very natural way to design software products, considering them as objects that communicate with each other. It is a very comprehensive idea, and it allows to decompose such objects and their design: you can build your product as a hierarchy of such objects, building bigger modules of your application from smaller ones.


That is why the majority of commonly-used and popular programming languages provide support for OOP. And Java was designed as an OOP language from the very beginning.

Then, how would we build a good object-oriented project? Besides the cornerstone concepts of OOP, we also need to study and use the SOLID design principles to build a comprehensive solution that would be easy to support. Also, we should consider using design patterns – best practices in organizing objects' creation, communication, structure, behavior.

We will review in detail Object-Oriented Programing, consider the main creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns, and gain hands-on experience of how to use them for the majority of cases. We will discover and practicecreating UML diagrams as a part of the analysis phase and using design patterns as a part of your project solution. After completing this module, you'll definitely switch to the OOP way of thinking.

By the end of this week, you will:

learn about Object-Oriented Software Design that can help you to switch to the OOP way of thinking
get familiar with the SOLID principles and be able to use them for the majority of cases
gain an understanding of the design patterns approach and discover the main creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns as well as get practical experience of how to use them

## Object-Oriented Thinking

What do a cookie, a mug, and programming have in common? «That's a weird question…» – you might think. Don't worry, soon you'll understand what's meant.

It is not a secret that Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can simplify your work and further development providing you with many tools that can be used instead of using scripts or just a "bag" of functions.

In this topic, you will build an understanding of what object-oriented design is, what its benefits are, and, most importantly, how to adopt the object-oriented way of thinking. Moreover, you'll gain knowledge about how to create objects and classes as well as discover what abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism are. Ready? Let's go!

### Object-Oriented Design
### How to Create Objects and Classes
### Abstraction
### Encapsulation
### Inheritance
### Polymorphism

## Design Pattern Principles

> Design patterns are reusable solutions that solve the challenges that software developers face over and over again. Instead of reinventing the wheel, learn how to make use of these proven and tested patterns that will make your software more flexible and resilient to change. This topic introduces you to design patterns and takes you through several of the most used object-oriented patterns.

### Fundamental Principles

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition
- Program to interfaces
- Loose coupling

### SOLID

S – Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only a reason to change.

O – Open Close Principle: Open for extensio, but closed for modification.

L – Liskov substitution Principle

I – Interface Segregation Principle

D – Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.


## Interface Pattern

> In this topic, you will learn about programming to interfaces. What is the main purpose of an interface? To separate functions from implementations. Any request that matches the signature or interface of an object may also be sent to that object, regardless of its implementation. Do you know what to add? Watch the videos to get comprehensive information on the topic.



## Strategy Pattern

> In the Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies according to its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object. In this topic, you'll learn why «has a» is better than «is a» and will be able to solve a little challenge related to the Strategy pattern.

## Decorator Pattern

### Understanging the Open-Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Composition**
- We can still "inherit" behavior
- We can make dynamic runtime decisions
- We can add new behavior without altering existing code
- We can include behaviors not considered by the creator


**Extending Behaviour with Composition**

### Understanding the Decorator Pattern

## Iterator Pattern

> One more pattern we'll review in our course is the Iterator pattern. It is a very commonly-used design pattern in Java. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in a sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation. The Iterator pattern falls under the behavioral pattern category. Stay tuned and move to the next sections.

This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.



## Factory Pattern

> And the last pattern we'll investigate in our course – the Factory pattern. It is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under the creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In the Factory pattern, we create an object without exposing the creation logic to a client and refer to the newly created object using a common interface. Watch the videos and get comprehensive information on the topic.



## Adapter Pattern

> The Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under the structural pattern as it combines the capability of two independent interfaces. Watch the videos in this section to explore the Adapter pattern and solve the challenge in the end.

## Observer Pattern

> When is the Observer pattern used? Let's say when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects. For example, if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. The Observer pattern falls under the behavioral pattern category. Let's take a closer look!



# Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms in Java
Algorithms and Data Structures are fundamental concepts of programming itself. Effective algorithms in a software product make this product fast, responsive, and optimal from the perspective of the operating cost. In order to build such algorithms, you have to understand data structures, their pros and cons, where they are suitable or not.

Another hint that we can give is that questions regarding algorithms and data structures are commonly asked during technical interviews.

If you want to learn core algorithms and data structures used in software development, it is exactly the right time and place. Get ready to explore the world of basic and advanced algorithms for searching and sorting. Also, you will have a chance to discover main data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, and hashtables.

If you have covered the IT Fundamentals course, you could be familiar with some concepts. In this case, feel free to skip some optional topics. However, if you are starting from scratch, don't worry – we've collected for you a lot of supporting materials.

By the end of this week, you will:

-   learn and practice the design of algorithms, including recursive ones
-   design and implement advanced data structures

## Analysis of Algorithms and Big O Notation (Optional)

How much space - Space Complexity
How much time - Time Complexity


## Linked Lists

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list

Nodes and Head (1st node)

Node: data / nextNode (null for last element)

Operations:

-  Inserting a New Node
- Length of a Linked List
- Deleting the Head Node
- Searching for an Item
- Inserting Data in a Sorted Linked List

Other Types

- Double Ended Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists

## Recursion

> **Recursion** is a mind-expanding technique which allows the use of advanced algorithms and data structures. To put it simply, recursion is the technique which enables a function to call itself. In the topic, you will start with implementing the factorial method using recursion. Then, you will be demonstrated how the recursion call stack works.




## Binary Search Trees: Overview and Basic Operations

## Binary Search Trees: Tree Traversal and Balancing

- In Order
- Pre Order
- Post Irder



# Java Generics and Collection Framework

By the end of this week, you will:

-   learn what Java Generics are
-   figure out how to generalize classes, interfaces, and methods
-   be able to limit a generic type by using upper and lower bounds
-   be able to use wildcards in Java
-   gain knowledge of what type erasure is and how it affects developers
-   know the hierarchy of the Collections Framework interfaces
-   investigate what Iterator is and why we might want to use it
-   figure out what ArrayList and LinkedList are and when we should choose one or another
-   be able to use HashMaps

## Java Generics

>Java Generics is a powerful addition to the Java language as it makes a programmer's job easier and less error-prone. So, this week we will analyze in detail what Generics are, why we might want to use them, how we can use them in different scenarios. Moreover, you will figure out what type a boundary is, why we have type erasure in Java, and what restrictions it brings to our design.

### What Are Generics in Java?

### Syntax

### Generic Classes in Java

### Generic Methods
```java
public static <E> void print(E[] list) {..}
```

* They introduce their own type parameters.
* The same method can be used for different reference types.
- Static and non-static methods can be generic.



### Generic Interfaces

### Using Wildcards in Generic Programming

### Type Erasure

## Collection Framework

> The Collections in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects. All data structures implement the Collection interface which is a part of the Collections Framework. In this topic, you will discover the hierarchy of the Java Collections Framework interfaces, the difference between them, and the most commonly used implementations of these interfaces as well as how to decide which one of them is suitable for solving a problem.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/index.html

### Collection Framework & Interface

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html

![The core collection interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/collections/colls-coreInterfaces.gif)

[![Collection Hierarchy in Java](https://www.scientecheasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/java-collection-hierarchy.png)](https://www.scientecheasy.com/2020/09/collection-hierarchy-in-java.html/)
#### Collection Framework
* It provides implementations of data structures.
* There is a Collections class that has static methods.
* The static methods can be used to sort, search, copy, and fill.
* Each method throws a NullPointerException if objects are null.

#### Collection Interface
* It defines common operations for data structures.
* Lists store an ordered collection of elements.
* A set stores a group of nonduplicate elements.
* Queues store objects that are processed in the FIFO order.
* Collections are sometimes referred to as containers.
* They are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and aggregate.
* Some containers store a collection of elements.
* Other containers store key/value pairs, called maps.
* The interface provides basic operations for add and remove.
* It also provides important query operations.
* A commonly used method is toArray (),which returns an array.
* To convert from an array to a list, use Arrays.tolList().





### Iterable interface

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html

- Each collection has an Iterator object to traverse the elements.
* It provides the tools for walking through a data structure.
* It hides the details of how data is stored.
- The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface.

* Methods in the Iterable interface are `iterator(), foreach()`.
- The `iterator()` method returns an Iterator object.
- The Iterator includes `hasNext(), next(), remove()`.
* The Iterable interface is used to traverse the elements.
* In addition to the Iterable interface, there is a `Listlterator`.
- The Listlterator is used for list data structures.
* This adds functionality to traverse the list backward.
- Methods include `previous(), hasPrevious(), previousIndex()`.

### ArrayList

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html

* Implements the List interface
* Is the most frequently used data structure
- Creates an object array that grows as needed
* Can contain duplicate elements
- An ArrayList can hold null values.
* It is not inherently thread safe.
* Quick access is provided to elements based in index position.
* Developers can add or remove elements by index value.

* Easily find the index of the first occurrence of an element.
* The initial size capacity can be set when created.
- The `trimTo()` method can reduce the size.

https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/arraylist



### LinkedList

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html

* Prior to Java 7, linked lists were created manually.
* Now, there is a LinkedList class included in the API.
* Access to the elements is linear.
* It uses a doubly linked list to manage the collection of objects.

# Functional Programming with Java Introduction

This week will help you to get comfortable with the concept of functional programming and its core principles. You will learn about the main features behind first-class functions and get familiar with higher-order functions.

You will be suggested to review more carefully two fundamental patterns that were introduced in Java 8 – lambda expressions and Stream API. Mastering these significant features will help you to start thinking in a paradigm of functional programming and enable 0622+type@asset+block/Java_W8_pic1_small_3x.png)

By the end of this week, you will:

-   understand principles, advantages, and capabilities of functional programming in Java
-   be able to use functional interfaces and lambdas in Java programs
-   be able to apply Stream API for processing collections of objects in Java programs

## Introduction to Functional Programming

> The key concept of this week is functional programming which is a way of organizing code that makes applications more scalable and maintainable. In this topic, you will discover the main differences between functional programming and object-oriented programming, and the ways these two approaches can complement each other. Also, you will explore three main concepts behind functional programming: immutability, functional purity, and first-class functions.

### Why use functional programming?
### What is declarative programming?
### Main Functional Programming Concepts:
- Immutability in functional programming
- Functional purity
- First-class functions

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html#package.description

## First-Class Functions

> Let's have a closer look at the concept of first-class functions. In the functional programming paradigm, functions are said to be first-class citizens. Basically, it means that Java treats functions in the same way as any other data type: functions can be assigned to variables and passed around as parameters.

>In this topic, you will be introduced to basic operations that are supported by first-class functions. Moreover, you will get familiar with a notion of a higher-order function that either takes a function as a parameter or returns a function after its execution.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html

###  The Function Interface

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

Interface Function<T,R>

apply(T t)

```

### Lambda Expressions
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html

```java
(parameterList) -> {statements}
```

### BiFunctions and Beyond

```java
import java.util.function.BiFunction;

BiFunction<T, U, R>
```

### Functions as Data

### Passing Functions as Argument

### Returning Functions

### Closure

### Higher-Order Functions




## Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions

> Now it's time to explore in detail lambda expressions, a relatively new feature that was included in Java 8. You'll start with functional interfaces which are interfaces that have only one abstract method. Then, you will see how lambdas provide a short and simple way to implement functional interfaces. Also, you will get familiar with method references that represent a shorthand way of writing a certain type of lambda expressions.

The videos above provide a brief introduction to the topic. To dive deeper into the topic of lambda expressions, take your time to explore a set of **optional** materials:

### Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions

A functional interface is an interface who has only one abstract method

_Functional interfaces_ provide target types for lambda expressions and method references. Each functional interface has a single abstract method, called the _functional method_ for that functional interface, to which the lambda expression's parameter and return types are matched or adapted. Functional interfaces can provide a target type in multiple contexts, such as assignment context, method invocation, or cast context

### Implementing lambdas in Java

### Using method references in Java

## Working with Streams in Java
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html

To perform a computation, stream [operations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps) are composed into a _stream pipeline_. A stream pipeline consists of a source (which might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel, etc), zero or more _intermediate operations_ (which transform a stream into another stream, such as [`filter(Predicate)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#filter-java.util.function.Predicate-)), and a _terminal operation_ (which produces a result or side-effect, such as [`count()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#count--) or [`forEach(Consumer)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-)). Streams are lazy; computation on the source data is only performed when the terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are consumed only as needed.

```java
.stream().filter().forEach();
.parallelStream()
```

### Map in Java

```java
.map(Function<T, R>)
.collect(Collectors.toList())
```

### Filter in Java

```java
.filter(Predicate<T>)
```

### Reduce in Java
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/reduction.html

```java
.reduce(startingValue, func)
.reduce(start, BinaryOperator<T>)
(acc, x) -> acc + x

reduce(func) ==> Optional<T>

```

### Collect in Java

```java
.collect(Collector<T, A, R>)
```

# I/O Streams and NIO.2 API in Java programs

This week you will continue to dive deeper into the world of Java and will be focusing on Java I/O Streams and the NIO.2 API. I/O is a crucial part of any programming language. All the enterprise systems, that we design and build, are receiving and transferring data in some way. I/O API in Java helps to describe such processes in Java solutions, design them to operate fast and be responsive. I/O serves as a basis for a lot of more specific APIs, so it is not a rare case when you need to use I/O API when designing a more business-oriented function, for instance, writing a response to an HTTP request in a web app.

To make I/O operations fast. We will guide you through the main I/O principles and demonstrate how to implement them. Moreover, during the latter half of the week, you'll investigate how to use the NIO.2 API to process streams of objects, and will be able to create a new file, work with directories in Java, and use files with the Path class.

By the end of this week, you will:

-   understand how to create and write data to a file
-   be able to work with directories and enumerate the elements inside
-   find out how to use the Path class to get basic system information for a specific file
-   get hands-on experience of how to read console input using a Scanner
-   get your hands dirty and use different approaches to read files with the BufferedReader implementation
-   get familiar with the try-with-resources structure and the magic that happens under the hood

## Java I/O Streams

> Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output. Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operations fast.
>
>In this topic, you will investigate the main Input and Output (IO) principles, gain knowledge of how to read the console input using a scanner and how to read files with BufferedReader. Finally, you will understand how to use try-with-resources with I/O.

### Understanding I/O in Java
The abstract classes `InputStream` and `OutputStream` are the basis for a hierarchy of input/output (I/O) classes.

The `OutputStreamWriter` class turns an output stream of Unicode code units into a stream of bytes, using a chosen character encoding. Conversely, the `InputStreamReader` class turns an input stream thatcontains bytes (specifying characters in some character encoding) into a reader that emits Unicode code units.

### Reading console input with a scanner

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scaner(System.in);

scanner.next();
scanner.nextInt();

```

### Reading files with BufferedReader
### Using try-with-resources with I/O

-   Chapter 2.1 Input/Output Streams
-   Chapter 2.2 Reading and Writing Binary Data
-   Chapter 2.3 Object Input/Output Streams and Serialization

## NIO.2 API

> NIO.2 was introduced with JDK 7 to provide enhanced support for file I/O and access to the default filesystem. It describes how to work with files and directories, iterate through the files inside any directories, get the information related to file resources. After reviewing this topic, you will be able to create a new file, work with directories in Java as well as use the Path class to manipulate with files.

A `Path` is a sequence of directory names, optionally followed by a filename.

### Creating a new file
### Working with directories in Java
### Using the Path class in Java
### Copying files with the Path class

## Summary

Your ninth week has come to an end. We managed to cover two big important topics: Java I/O streams and Java NIO.2 API.

In the beginning, you investigated the I/O Principles in Java, learned how to read console input using a scanner, how to read files with BufferedReader, and how to use the try-with-resource statement.

In the second part of our module, you have dived into using the NIO.2 API to process streams of objects and learned how to create a new file, work with directories in Java as well as use the Path class to manipulate with files.

# Java Concurrency Essentials

> These days you cannot avoid creating multithreaded programs. A modern PC has multiple CPU cores, servers may have over a hundred of them, and even smartphones have several. Besides, the requirements for software systems are also high, some systems must process millions and billions of requests and transactions, your browser must show you a page as fast as possible, play music in the background, and download some files. And that is just a small part of all the processes which modern applications must handle. So, parallelism and concurrency are among the most crucial skills which a developer has to master.

> This week, you will discover parallel and concurrent executions and the ways to write such programs in Java. You will learn what processes and threads are, how they relate to each other, why we might need to synchronize parallel execution flows, how we can achieve it in Java, and what problems those mechanisms might cause.

By the end of this week, you will:

-   explore parallel and concurrent executions
-   become aware of execution scheduling and how it affects parallel code
-   see the difference between a thread and a process and how they relate to each other
-   discover the basics of the lifecycle of a thread and learn about daemon thread
-   create and manage threads in Java
-   get familiar with a data race
-   synchronize multiple threads in Java
-   figure out the basic information about atomics
-   define the problems that might occur in parallel code when synchronization takes place

## Parallel Programming Essentials

>The main concept that you will comprehend this week is parallel computing which is used to execute different parts of a program at the same time. In this topic, you will see the main differences between sequential and parallel computing and how it relates to the process of making a salad. Also, you will learn how different types of parallel computers are structured, how memory is organized, and how a computer accesses data.

>Another aspect that we will explore in this topic is the difference between a thread and a process, and you will see which one is better: using multiple threads or multiple processes?

>Finally, you will learn how concurrent execution differs from parallel execution and how OS task scheduling might affect your programs.

### Shared vs. Distributed Memory

### Thread vs. Process
### Concurrent vs. Parallel Execution
### Execution Scheduling
### Execution Scheduling: Java

## Java Threads

> In this topic, you will delve into the lifecycle of threads and explore the general existing phases (new, runnable, blocked, and terminated) and two specific phases for Java threads. Also, you will explore thread attributes and a few helpful properties and methods for Java threads that you should be aware of. You will discover the following threads – main, child, and daemon thread, as well as go through the processes of their creation, configuration, and execution with examples.

### Thread lifecycle

Main Thread -> Child Thread

Four stages:
- New state
- Runnable (start)
- Blocked (waiting/resume)
- Terminated (finish)

### Daemon thread

+ Does not prevent the process from terminating
+ By default, threads are created as non-daemon

### Thread lifecycle: Java demo

- NEW
- RUNNABLE
- BLOCKED
- WAITING
- TIMED_WAITING
- TERMINATED

### Thread attributes: Java demo

```java
Thread.currentThread()
getID()
```

Thread ID
Thread Name (set/get)
Thread Priority (set/get)

### Runnable vs. thread: Java demo

Extending Thread class 
- Cannot extend additional classes
- Each instance is a separate object

Implementing Runnable interface
- Can implement other interfaces and extend another class
- Multiple threads can share a single Runnable object

### Daemon thread: Java demo

* New threads will inherit daemon status from their parent
+ Use setDaemon () method to change status before starting thread
* When the JVM halts, any remaining daemon threads are abandoned

## Synchronization Primitives

> Anytime multiple threads are concurrently accessing the same location in memory, there is a possibility of a data race. What is that? It is a common problem, that will be disclosed in this topic. You will also discover how to protect yourself from that by identifying and protecting critical sections of code. In the video chapters below, we will explain why synchronization of a program is important, how we can achieve it, and what tools Java provides us with to achieve this purpose.

### Data race

+ Pay attention whenever two or more threads access the same resource

  
### Mutual exclusion

Critical Section: 
+ Code segment that accesses a shared resource 
* Should not be executed by more than one thread or process at a time


#### Mutex(lock)

* Mechanism to implement mutual exclusion
* Only one thread or process can possess at a time
* Limits access to critical section

#### Atomic Operations

- Execute as a single action, relative to other threads
- Cannot be interrupted by other concurrent threads



### Atomic variable

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html

### Synchronized method

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html

### Synchronized statement

Specify the object to provide the intrinsic lock

## Synchronization Pitfalls

> In this topic, we will dig deeper in the direction of synchronization issues. In the videos below, you will explore the most common problems which might occur in parallel execution – deadlock, abandoned lock, starvation, and livelock. At first, they will be discussed in general and then, demonstrated using specific code examples. We want our programs to be well-written, with liveness. In other words, with no chance for these problems to appear. To achieve that, you have to recognize these problems and find the ways to avoid them. Start watching!

### Deadlock

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html

How to prevent it:

Lock Ordering: Ensure locks are always taken in the same order by any thread

Lock Timeout:

* Put a timeout on lock attempts
+ If a thread cannot acquire all locks within time limit:
	* Back up and free all locks taken
	* Wait for a random amount of time
	* Try again!

## Starvation

A process or thread is perpetually denied the resources it needs

## Livelock

 Multiple threads or processes are actively responding to each other to resolve conflict, but that prevents them from making progress






# Java Concurrency Essentials (Part 2)

## Advanced Synchronization. Locking

This topic will introduce you to different types of locks in Java and the ways to execute some code in case locking is not possible. Imagine a situation when multiple threads have multiple tasks to perform, and the lock blocks those threads and makes them wait every time they attempt to acquire a lock. Or when threads simply need to read from the same location at the same time without any locks that would slow the process.

In these and many other specific cases, it is better to use a special kind of mutex. It could be a reentrant lock, a try lock, a read-write lock, or a semaphore — you will review all of them in a fun and entertaining way based on some day-to-day activities. Also, with the help of a few practical examples, you will see how these locks can be applied using Java.

### Reentrant Lock

* Can be locked multiple times by the same thread
- Must be unlocked as many times as it was locked


### Reentrant Lock: Java Demo

### Try Lock

* Non-blocking lock/acquire method for mutex
* If the mutex is available, lock it and return TRUE
* If the mutex is not available, immediately return FALSE


### Try Lock: Java Demo


### Read-write Lock
### Read-write Lock: Java Demo
### Semaphore
A semaphore allows N threads to enter the critical section.

### Semaphore: Java Demo


## Advanced Synchronization. Conditional Locking

### Condition Variable

## Design Principles of Parallel Computing

> This topic offers you an explanation of how to transform single-threaded code into multi-threaded one using different algorithms, such as a divide and conquer algorithm. Moreover, you will learn how to design a parallel program in general. We will go through the basic four-step methodology for developing a parallel solution for a case. This methodology consists of four stages: partitioning, communication, agglomeration, and mapping. You will consider the stages and the goals that have to be reached at the end of each stage.

### Divide and Conquer
### Divide and Conquer: Java Demo
### Partitioning
The process of dividing a large problem into smaller parts

### Communication
The process of establishing execution flow and data sharing between parts

### Agglomeration
The process of grouping tasks in order to increase the effectiveness of a program

### Mapping
The process of assigning tasks to their executors
