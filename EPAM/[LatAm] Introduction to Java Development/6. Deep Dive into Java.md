# Introduction to Maven and JUnit
## XML and JSON Overview

> Both JSON and XML are commonly used in everyday programming challenges to pass data back and forth between software programs. In this topic, you will cover the basics of JSON and XML, including common use cases. Learning how to create and document structured data using JSON and XML can add extra value to your Java developer's toolbox. Additionally, understanding JSON and XML will be quite handy for the upcoming topics of this week.

## JSON

### Basic Data Types

- Strings: text enclosed in doubles quotes
- Numbers: integer or decimal, positive or negative
- Booleans: true or false
- Null: nothing
- Arrays: they are list using square brackets `[ ]`, you can mix data
- Objects: JSON dictionaries, use curly brackets `{ }`, keys and values can be any type.

### Nesting
You can put things inside others, arrays inside arrays, or objects, etc

## XML

Stands for Extensible Markup Language, it is like HTML

- Tags
- Content
- Nested Tags
- Attributes

> You can ignore the first line of an XML file, it is a declaration.


## Getting Started with Apache Maven

> Apache Maven is a software project management tool that makes Java programming easier. In this topic, we’ll guide you step by step through the installation process and get you prepared for your first project in Maven. Along the way, you will get familiar with the substantial benefits that Apache Maven brings to you as a software developer.

## Understanding Maven

> Upon completion of this topic, you will understand better the concepts of POM’s standards, a project life cycle, a repository, and a dependency management system.

### POM

Project Objet Model, default behaviors, folder structure, standarization over configuration.

It contains:

- Project description
- Coordinates => `groupId + artifactId + version`
- Attributes
- Licences information
- Version
- Authors and Contributors
- Dependencies

### Maven lifecycle

#### Lifecycle
- Generate a project
- Execute Maven (plugin goals)
- Install a Maven artifact
- Run the app

#### Default phases:
- Validate the project is correct
- Compile
- Test
- Package
- Integration-test
- Verify
- Install
- Deploy


## Creating a Project with Maven

## Testing with Maven

## Write unit tests

`mvn test`

### Adding Dependencies

## JUnit Basics

## JUnit Options

### Basic unit tests

Things to do:
- Annotate a method with `@Tests`
- Import `org.junit.Assert.*;`
- Add assert statement to test program logic

### Exception handling tests

```java
@Test (expected = IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)  
public void testMain(){  
    new ArrayList<Object>().get(0);  
}
```

### Ignore tests

`@Ignore[("Message")]`

### Parameterized tests

```java
@Parameters

@RunWith(value = Parameterized.class)
```

## XML Overview (Optional)

### Types of XML content

- The Document Declaration
- 

## XPath and XSLT (Optional)

### What is XPath?

https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/

#### Important XPath Concepts
- Context node: path evaluation starts from here
- Axis: relation between context and selected nodes
- Predicates: further refinements to selection process

#### Important DOM Functions

## Exercise

### Suffixing App

The purpose of this exercise is to teach you to design and build a Java application all by yourself, based on high-level requirements. You will have to handle command-line arguments, work with files, and use logging.

This week, you have learned about Java Logging and the most popular Java logging frameworks. Also, now you know more about the types of XML content, the meaning of well-formed and valid XML documents, and the purpose of XML namespaces. Then, we moved on to creating and transforming XML content with the help of XPath and XSLT. You have explored how to define an XML document structure using a DTD and an XML Schema.

At the end of this week, you have seen several different APIs, discovered how to create and parse XML documents, and reviewed the provided examples. So far so good!
