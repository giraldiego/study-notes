1. Acquiring python coding skills
 1.1 Beginner
 1.2 Intermediate
 1.3 Advanced

2. Data structures and algorithms
 1.1 Using right data structure at right time. For example in this problem I've a list of customers and I want to extract list of unique countries. I can do it using a list but If I use set it will be more efficient and appropriate because set gurantees uniqueness

3. Debugging skills
 1.1 All expert programmers I've worked with are very good in debugging
 1.2 Sometimes people don't know what a conditional break point is
  a. I've a small playlist on debugging skills: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu-0i4uha0_lZwh5PpIWB1T) 
  
4. Using libraries wisely
 1.1 Numpy - numeric computing library for matrices and multi dimensional arrays
  a. I've seen programmers using python list for heavy numeric computing just because they dont know about numpy
 1.2 Pandas - for data cleaning and data analysis
 1.3 Scipy - Scientific computing

5. Coding best practices, PEP8 convention
 1.1 Refer to these guidelines for coding best practices such as.
  a. Compact code
  b. Optimize variable creation
  c. Avoid abbreviations as much as you can
  d.

6. Opensource contribution and participate in code reviews
 1.1 Chance to interact with experts. You learn a lot from code reviews
 1.2 Show sample PR discussion: [https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/...](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/7217)
 1.3 Also review others code. This way you can learn from the code author as well as other reviewers 
 
7. Master the art of asking for a help
 1.1 Google skills: You need to know how to ask right question
 1.2 Protocol when you are asking for a help. Stack overflow. Show that you have tried first.

8. Projects, projects, projects

Python projects playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usVcPj6osMx1tNkARllcRhZ)

 1.1 Start automating repetitive tasks with python
 1.2 If you have a job then use these skills for projects at job 
 1.2 If you don't have a job 
  a. NGOs, relatives grocery store or a doctor
  b. Video on how to get projects when you don't have a job: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fqu2...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fqu2m7O8VI)
